Bee Movie
By Jerry Seinfeld

NARRATOR:
(Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
According to all known laws
of aviation,
 :
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
 :
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
 :
The bee, of course, flies anyway
 :
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
BARRY BENSON:
(Barry is picking out a shirt)
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
 :
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
JANET BENSON:
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
BARRY:
Coming!
 :
Hang on a second.
(Barry uses his antenna like a phone)
 :
Hello?
ADAM FLAYMAN:

(Through phone)
- Barry?
BARRY:
- Adam?
ADAM:
- Can you believe this is happening?
BARRY:
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
(Barry flies down the stairs)
 :
MARTIN BENSON:
Looking sharp.
JANET:
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
BARRY:
Sorry. I'm excited.
MARTIN:
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
 :
A perfect report card, all B's.
JANET:
Very proud.
(Rubs Barry's hair)
BARRY=
Ma! I got a thing going here.
JANET:
- You got lint on your fuzz.
BARRY:
- Ow! That's me!

JANET:
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!
(Barry flies out the door)
JANET:
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
(Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a
newspaper)
BARRY==
- Hey, Adam.
ADAM:
- Hey, Barry.
(Adam gets in Barry's car)
 :
- Is that fuzz gel?
BARRY:
- A little. Special day, graduation.
ADAM:
Never thought I'd make it.
(Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)
BARRY:
Three days grade school,
three days high school...
ADAM:
Those were awkward.
BARRY:
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
ADAM==
You did come back different.
(Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging)
ARTIE:
- Hi, Barry!

BARRY:
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
ADAM:
- Hear about Frankie?
BARRY:
- Yeah.
ADAM==
- You going to the funeral?
BARRY:
- No, I'm not going to his funeral.
 :
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.
 :
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
ADAM:
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
(The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the
highway)
 :
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our regular day.
BARRY:
I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
(Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating
students)
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.
(Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)
 :
- Well, Adam, today we are men.

ADAM:
- We are!
BARRY=
- Bee-men.
=ADAM=
- Amen!
BARRY AND ADAM:
Hallelujah!
(Barry and Adam both have a happy spasm)
ANNOUNCER:
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
 :
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
DEAN BUZZWELL:
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...
 :
...9:
 :
That concludes our ceremonies.
 :
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
ADAM:
Will we pick our job today?
(Adam and Barry get into a tour bus)
BARRY=
I heard it's just orientation.
(Tour buses rise out of the ground and the students are automatically
loaded into the buses)
TOUR GUIDE:
Heads up! Here we go.

ANNOUNCER:
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
BARRY:
- Wonder what it'll be like?
ADAM:
- A little scary.
TOUR GUIDE==
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
 :
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
Barry:
This is it!
BARRY AND ADAM:
Wow.
BARRY:
Wow.
(The bus drives down a road an on either side are the Bee's massive
complicated Honey-making machines)
TOUR GUIDE:
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
 :
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
 :
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
 :
Our top-secret formula
 :
is automatically color-corrected,

scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
 :
into this soothing sweet syrup
 :
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
EVERYONE ON BUS:
Honey!
(The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into
the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a girl in the back)
ADAM:
- That girl was hot.
BARRY:
- She's my cousin!
ADAM==
- She is?
BARRY:
- Yes, we're all cousins.
ADAM:
- Right. You're right.
TOUR GUIDE:
- At Honex, we constantly strive
 :
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
 :
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.
(The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into the
ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but
you can hear him groan)
 :
ADAM==

- What do you think he makes?
BARRY:
- Not enough.
TOUR GUIDE:
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.
(They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each
wearing a finger-shaped hat)
Barry:
- Wow, What does that do?
TOUR GUIDE:
- Catches that little strand of honey
 :
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
ADAM:
(Intrigued)
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
TOUR GUIDE:
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones.
But bees know that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
 :
But choose carefully
 :
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
(Everyone claps except for Barry)
BARRY:
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
ADAM:

What's the difference?
TOUR GUIDE:
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
 :
in 27 million years.
BARRY:
(Upset)
So you'll just work us to death?
 :
We'll sure try.
(Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back
home together)
ADAM:
Wow! That blew my mind!
BARRY:
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
 :
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
ADAM:
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.
BARRY:
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?
ADAM:
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
 :
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

BARRY:
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?
ADAM:
Like what? Give me one example.
(Barry and Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the audience that
hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect
unison)
BARRY:
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.
ANNOUNCER:
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
BARRY:
Wait a second. Check it out.
(The Pollen jocks fly in, circle around and landing in line)
 :
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
ADAM:
- Wow.
 :
I've never seen them this close.
BARRY:
They know what it's like
outside the hive.
ADAM:
Yeah, but some don't come back.
GIRL BEES:
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!
(The Pollen Jocks hook up their backpacks to machines that pump the nectar
to trucks, which drive away)

LOU LO DUVA:
You guys did great!
 :
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks!
I love it!
(Punching the Pollen Jocks in joy)
I love it!
ADAM:
- I wonder where they were.
BARRY:
- I don't know.
 :
Their day's not planned.
 :
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.
 :
You can't just decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
ADAM==
Right.
(Barry and Adam are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen
Jocks)
BARRY:
Look at that. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
ADAM:
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
BARRY:
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.
(Barry waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them)

ADAM==
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
BARRY:
Distant. Distant.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
Look at these two.
POLLEN JOCK #2:
- Couple of Hive Harrys.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
- Let's have fun with them.
GIRL BEE #1:
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.
BARRY:
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!
 :
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!
(Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario)
GIRL BEE #2:
- Oh, my!
BARRY:
- I never thought I'd knock him out.
GIRL BEE #1:
(Looking at Adam)
What were you doing during this?
ADAM:
Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
BARRY:
I can autograph that.

(The pollen jocks walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and
Adam really are pollen jocks.)
POLLEN JOCK #1:
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?
BARRY:
Yeah. Gusty.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.
BARRY:
- Six miles, huh?
ADAM:
- Barry!
POLLEN JOCK #2:
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.
BARRY:
- Maybe I am.
ADAM:
- You are not!
POLLEN JOCK #1:
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
 :
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
BARRY:
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.
(The scene cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from his balcony at
night)
MARTIN:

Hey, Honex!
BARRY:
Dad, you surprised me.
MARTIN:
You decide what you're interested in?
BARRY:
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.
 :
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?
MARTIN:
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
 :
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.
 :
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
BARRY:
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,
 :
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.
MARTIN:
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?
 :
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.
 :

Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!
JANET:
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
BARRY:
- I'm not trying to be funny.
MARTIN:
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
JANET:
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
BARRY:
- No one's listening to me!
MARTIN:
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
BARRY:
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
(Barry's parents don't listen to him and continue to ramble on)
MARTIN:
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
BARRY:
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.
 :
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
JANET:
I'm so proud.
(The scene cuts to Barry and Adam waiting in line to get a job)
ADAM:
- We're starting work today!

BARRY:
- Today's the day.
ADAM:
Come on! All the good jobs
will be gone.
BARRY:
Yeah, right.
JOB LISTER:
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
BEE IN FRONT OF LINE:
- Is it still available?
JOB LISTER:
- Hang on. Two left!
 :
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
ADAM:
- What'd you get?
BEE IN FRONT OF LINE:
- Picking crud out. Stellar!
(He walks away)
ADAM:
Wow!
JOB LISTER:
Couple of newbies?
ADAM:
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
JOB LISTER:
Make your choice.
(Adam and Barry look up at the job board. There are hundreds of constantly
changing panels that contain available or unavailable jobs. It looks very
confusing)

ADAM:
- You want to go first?
BARRY:
- No, you go.
ADAM:
Oh, my. What's available?
JOB LISTER:
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.
ADAM:
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
JOB LISTER:
- Sure, you're on.
(Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam's head)
(Suddenly the sign for Krelman closes out)
 :
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
(Takes Adam's hat off)
Wax monkey's always open.
ADAM:
The Krelman opened up again.
 :
What happened?
JOB LISTER:
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.
 :
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
 :
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

ADAM:
Oh, this is so hard!
(Barry remembers what the Pollen Jock offered him and he flies off)
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
 :
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
 :
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?
(Adam turns around and sees Barry flying away)
 :
Barry!
POLLEN JOCK:
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...
ADAM:
(Through phone)
What happened to you?
Where are you?
BARRY:
- I'm going out.
ADAM:
- Out? Out where?
BARRY:
- Out there.
ADAM:
- Oh, no!
BARRY:
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.
ADAM:

You're gonna die! You're crazy!
(Barry hangs up)
Hello?
POLLEN JOCK #2:
Another call coming in.
 :
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd
 :
that gets their roses today.
BARRY:
Hey, guys.
POLLEN JOCK #1 ==
- Look at that.
POLLEN JOCK #2:
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
LOU LO DUVA:
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
(Puts hand on Barry's shoulder)
LOU LO DUVA:
(To Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
BEE WITH CLIPBOARD:
(To Barry) Sign here, here. Just initial that.
 :
- Thank you.
LOU LO DUVA:
- OK.
 :
You got a rain advisory today,
 :

and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.
 :
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,
 :
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.
 :
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.
 :
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!
BARRY:
- That's awful.
LOU LO DUVA:
(Still talking through megaphone)
- And a reminder for you rookies,
 :
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!
 :
All right, launch positions!
POLLEN JOCKS:
(The Pollen Jocks run into formation)
 :
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
LOU LU DUVA:
Black and yellow!
POLLEN JOCKS:

Hello!
POLLEN JOCK #1:
(To Barry)You ready for this, hot shot?
BARRY:
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
POLLEN JOCK's:
Wind, check.
 :
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.
 :
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.
BARRY:
Scared out of my shorts, check.
LOU LO DUVA:
OK, ladies,
 :
let's move it out!
 :
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!
 :
All of you, drain those flowers!
(The pollen jocks fly out of the hive)
BARRY:
Wow! I'm out!
 :
I can't believe I'm out!
 :
So blue.

 :
I feel so fast and free!
 :
Box kite!
(Barry flies through the kite)
 :
Wow!
 :
Flowers!
(A pollen jock puts on some high tech goggles that shows flowers similar to
heat sink goggles.)
POLLEN JOCK:
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.
 :
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
 :
Roses!
POLLEN JOCK #1:
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
 :
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
(The pollen jock fires a high-tech gun at the flower, shooting tubes that
suck up the nectar from the flower and collects it into a pouch on the gun)
BARRY:
That is one nectar collector!
POLLEN JOCK #1==
- Ever see pollination up close?
BARRY:
- No, sir.
POLLEN JOCK #1:

(Barry and the Pollen jock fly over the field, the pollen jock sprinkles
pollen as he goes)
 :
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,
 :
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
BARRY:
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
POLLEN JOCK #1:
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
BARRY:
Cool.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
could be daisies. Don't we need those?
POLLEN JOCK #2:
Copy that visual.
 :
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?
POLLEN JOCK #2:
Affirmative.
(The Pollen jocks land near the "flowers" which, to the audience are
obviously just tennis balls)
KEN:
(In the distance) That was on the line!

POLLEN JOCK #1:
This is the coolest. What is it?
POLLEN JOCK #2:
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
 :
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
Yeah, fuzzy.
(Sticks his hand on the ball but it gets stuck)
POLLEN JOCK #3==
Chemical-y.
(The pollen jock finally gets his hand free from the tennis ball)
POLLEN JOCK #1:
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
(The pollen jocks turn around and see Barry lying his entire body on top of
one of the tennis balls)
POLLEN JOCK #2:
My sweet lord of bees!
POLLEN JOCK #3:
Candy-brain, get off there!
POLLEN JOCK #1:
(Pointing upwards)
Problem!
(A human hand reaches down and grabs the tennis ball that Barry is stuck
to)
BARRY:
- Guys!
POLLEN JOCK #2:
- This could be bad.
POLLEN JOCK #3:
Affirmative.
(Vanessa Bloome starts bouncing the tennis ball, not knowing Barry is stick
to it)

BARRY==
Very close.
 :
Gonna hurt.
 :
Mama's little boy.
(Barry is being hit back and forth by two humans playing tennis. He is
still stuck to the ball)
POLLEN JOCK #1:
You are way out of position, rookie!
KEN:
Coming in at you like a MISSILE!
(Barry flies past the pollen jocks, still stuck to the ball)
BARRY:
(In slow motion)
Help me!
POLLEN JOCK #2:
I don't think these are flowers.
POLLEN JOCK #3:
- Should we tell him?
POLLEN JOCK #1:
- I think he knows.
BARRY:
What is this?!
KEN:
Match point!
 :
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to EAT IT!
(A pollen jock coughs which confused Ken and he hits the ball the wrong way
with Barry stuck to it and it goes flying into the city)
BARRY:

Yowser!
(Barry bounces around town and gets stuck in the engine of a car. He flies
into the air conditioner and sees a bug that was frozen in there)
BARRY:
Ew, gross.
(The man driving the car turns on the air conditioner which blows Barry
into the car)
GIRL IN CAR:
There's a bee in the car!
 :
- Do something!
DAD DRIVING CAR:
- I'm driving!
BABY GIRL:
(Waving at Barry)
- Hi, bee.
(Barry smiles and waves at the baby girl)
GUY IN BACK OF CAR:
- He's back here!
 :
He's going to sting me!
GIRL IN CAR:
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!
(Barry freezes as well, hovering in the middle of the car)
 :
GRANDMA IN CAR==
He blinked!
(The grandma whips out some bee-spray and sprays everywhere in the car,
climbing into the front seat, still trying to spray Barry)
GIRL IN CAR:
Spray him, Granny!
DAD DRIVING THE CAR:
What are you doing?!
(Barry escapes the car through the air conditioner and is flying high above

the ground, safe.)
BARRY:
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.
(Barry sees that storm clouds are gathering and he can see rain clouds
moving into this direction)
 :
I gotta get home.
 :
Can't fly in rain.
 :
Can't fly in rain.
(A rain drop hits Barry and one of his wings is damaged)
 :
Can't fly in rain.
(A second rain drop hits Barry again and he spirals downwards)
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
(WW2 plane sound effects are played as he plummets, and he crash-lands on a
plant inside an apartment near the window)
VANESSA BLOOME:
Ken, could you close
the window please?
KEN==
Hey, check out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.
 :
You see?
(Folds brochure resume out)
Folds out.
(Ken closes the window, trapping Barry inside)
BARRY:
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
(Barry tries to fly away but smashes into the window and falls again)
 :
What was that?

(Barry keeps trying to fly out the window but he keeps being knocked back
because the window is closed)
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...
 :
Drapes!
(Barry taps the glass. He doesn't understand what it is)
That is diabolical.
KEN:
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
ANDY:
What's number one? Star Wars?
KEN:
Nah, I don't go for that...
(Ken makes finger guns and makes "pew pew pew" sounds and then stops)
 :
...kind of stuff.
BARRY:
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.
KEN:
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
BARRY:
(Looking at the light on the ceiling)
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
(Starts flying towards the lightbulb)
 :
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.
(Barry hits the lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table that the
humans are sitting at)
KEN:

I predicted global warming.
 :
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.
(Andy dips a chip into the bowl and scoops up some dip with Barry on it and
is about to put it in his mouth)
 :
Wait! Stop! Bee!
(Andy drops the chip with Barry in fear and backs away. All the humans
freak out)
 :
Stand back. These are winter boots.
(Ken has winter boots on his hands and he is about to smash the bee but
Vanessa saves him last second)
VANESSA:
Wait!
 :
Don't kill him!
(Vanessa puts Barry in a glass to protect him)
KEN:
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!
VANESSA:
Why does his life have
less value than yours?
KEN:
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?
VANESSA:
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.
(Vanessa picks up Ken's brochure and puts it under the glass so she can
carry Barry back to the window. Barry looks at Vanessa in amazement)
KEN:

My brochure!
VANESSA:
There you go, little guy.
(Vanessa opens the window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is
still shocked that a human saved his life)
KEN:
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.
VANESSA:
Put that on your resume brochure.
KEN:
My whole face could puff up.
ANDY:
Make it one of your special skills.
KEN:
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.
(Ken walks to the door)
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
 :
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
VANESSA:
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
 :
(Vanessa tries to close door)
KEN==
- You could put carob chips on there.
VANESSA:
- Bye.
(Closes door but Ken opens it again)
KEN:
- Supposed to be less calories.

VANESSA:
- Bye.
(Closes door)
(Fast forward to the next day, Barry is still inside the house. He flies
into the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes)
BARRY==
(Talking to himself)
I gotta say something.
 :
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.
 :
All right, here it goes.
(Turns back)
Nah.
 :
What would I say?
 :
I could really get in trouble.
 :
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.
 :
I can't believe I'm doing this.
 :
I've got to.
(Barry disguises himself as a character on a food can as Vanessa walks by
again)
 :
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
 :
No. Yes. No.
 :
Do it. I can't.

 :
How should I start it?
(Barry strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows)
"You like jazz?"
No, that's no good.
(Vanessa is about to walk past Barry)
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
 :
...Hi!
(Vanessa gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the
counter)
 :
I'm sorry.
VANESSA:
- You're talking.
BARRY:
- Yes, I know.
VANESSA:
(Pointing at Barry)
You're talking!
BARRY:
I'm so sorry.
VANESSA:
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.
 :
But I don't recall going to bed.
BARRY:
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.
VANESSA:
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

BARRY:
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,
(Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night)
but they were all trying to kill me.
 :
And if it wasn't for you...
 :
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.
(Vanessa stabs her hand with a fork to test whether she's dreaming or not)
 :
That was a little weird.
VANESSA:
- I'm talking with a bee.
BARRY:
- Yeah.
VANESSA:
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!
BARRY:
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
(Barry turns to leave)
VANESSA:
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
BARRY:
(Flying back)
- What?
VANESSA:
The talking...thing.
BARRY:

Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
VANESSA:
- That's very funny.
BARRY:
- Yeah.
 :
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
 :
Anyway...
VANESSA:
Can I...
 :
...get you something?
BARRY:
- Like what?
VANESSA:
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Coffee?
BARRY:
I don't want to put you out.
VANESSA:
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
 :
- It's just coffee.
BARRY:
- I hate to impose.
(Vanessa starts making coffee)
VANESSA:
- Don't be ridiculous!

BARRY:
- Actually, I would love a cup.
VANESSA:
Hey, you want rum cake?
BARRY:
- I shouldn't.
VANESSA:
- Have some.
BARRY:
- No, I can't.
VANESSA:
- Come on!
BARRY:
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
VANESSA:
- Where?
BARRY:
- These stripes don't help.
VANESSA:
You look great!
BARRY:
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.
 :
Are you all right?
VANESSA:
(Pouring coffee on the floor and missing the cup completely)
No.
(Flash forward in time. Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table
on top of the apartment building drinking coffee)

 :
BARRY==
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.
 :
He finally gets there.
 :
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
 :
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.
 :
Why would I marry a watermelon?"
(Barry laughs but Vanessa looks confused)
VANESSA:
Is that a bee joke?
BARRY:
That's the kind of stuff we do.
VANESSA:
Yeah, different.
 :
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
(Barry stands on top of a sugar cube floating in his coffee and paddles it
around with a straw like it's a gondola)
BARRY:
About work? I don't know.
 :
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.
VANESSA:
I know how you feel.

BARRY:
- You do?
VANESSA:
- Sure.
 :
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
BARRY:
- Really?
VANESSA:
- My only interest is flowers.
BARRY:
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.
 :
Anyway, if you look...
(Barry points to a tree in the middle of Central Park)
 :
There's my hive right there. See it?
VANESSA:
You're in Sheep Meadow!
BARRY:
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
VANESSA:
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.
BARRY:
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
VANESSA:
- Why not?
BARRY:

- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
VANESSA:
- Maybe I'll try that.
(A custodian installing a lightbulb looks over at them but to his
perspective it looks like Vanessa is talking to a cup of coffee on the
table)
CUSTODIAN:
- You all right, ma'am?
VANESSA:
- Oh, yeah. Fine.
 :
Just having two cups of coffee!
BARRY:
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.
VANESSA==
Yeah, it's no trouble.
BARRY:
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.
(Barry points towards the rum cake)
 :
Can I take a piece of this with me?
VANESSA:
Sure! Here, have a crumb.
(Vanessa hands Barry a crumb but it is still pretty big for Barry)
BARRY:
- Thanks!
VANESSA:
- Yeah.
BARRY:
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

 :
Or not.
VANESSA:
OK, Barry...
BARRY:
And thank you
so much again... for before.
VANESSA:
Oh, that? That was nothing.
BARRY:
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
(Vanessa and Barry hold hands, but Vanessa has to hold out a finger because
her hands is to big and Barry holds that)
(The custodian looks over again and it appears Vanessa is laughing at her
coffee again. The lightbulb that he was screwing in sparks and he falls off
the ladder)
(Fast forward in time and we see two Bee Scientists testing out a parachute
in a Honex wind tunnel)
BEE SCIENTIST #1:
This can't possibly work.
BEE SCIENTIST #2:
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
 :
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
(Dave pulls the chute and the wind slams him against the wall and he falls
on his face.The camera pans over and we see Barry and Adam walking
together)
ADAM:
- Sounds amazing.
BARRY:
- It was amazing!
 :
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

ADAM:
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!
 :
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?
BARRY:
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
 :
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
ADAM:
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
BARRY:
- Some of them. But some of them don't.
ADAM:
- How'd you get back?
BARRY:
- Poodle.
ADAM:
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.
 :
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out your job and be normal.
BARRY:
- Well...
ADAM:
- Well?
BARRY:
Well, I met someone.

ADAM:
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
 :
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
BARRY:
- No, no, no, not a wasp.
ADAM:
- Spider?
BARRY:
- I'm not attracted to spiders.
 :
I know, for everyone else, it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.
 :
I can't get by that face.
ADAM:
So who is she?
BARRY:
She's... human.
ADAM:
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.
BARRY:
- Her name's Vanessa.
(Adam puts his head in his hands)
ADAM:
- Oh, boy.
BARRY==
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
ADAM:
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

BARRY:
We're not dating.
ADAM:
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes
 :
with power washers and M-80s!
That's one-eighth a stick of dynamite!
BARRY:
She saved my life!
And she understands me.
ADAM:
This is over!
BARRY:
Eat this.
(Barry gives Adam a piece of the crumb that he got from Vanessa. Adam eats
it)
ADAM:
(Adam's tone changes)
This is not over! What was that?
BARRY:
- They call it a crumb.
ADAM:
- It was so stingin' stripey!
BARRY:
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!
 :
- You know what a Cinnabon is?
ADAM:
- No.
(Adam opens a door behind him and he pulls Barry in)

BARRY:
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
ADAM:
Be quiet!
BARRY:
They heat it up...
ADAM:
Sit down!
(Adam forces Barry to sit down)
BARRY:
(Still rambling about Cinnabons)
...really hot!
(Adam grabs Barry by the shoulders)
ADAM:
- Listen to me!
 :
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
BARRY==
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?
ADAM:
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!
 :
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!
BARRY:
- Thinking bee.
WORKER BEE:
- Thinking bee.
WORKER BEES AND ADAM:
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
(Flash forward in time; Barry is laying on a raft in a pool full of honey.
He is wearing sunglasses)
JANET:
There he is. He's in the pool.
MARTIN:
You know what your problem is, Barry?
(Barry pulls down his sunglasses and he looks annoyed)
BARRY:
(Sarcastic)
I gotta start thinking bee?
JANET:
How much longer will this go on?
MARTIN:
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?
(Puts sunglasses back on)
BARRY:
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.
MARTIN:
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!
JANET:
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?
(Barry rolls off the raft and sinks into the honey pool)
 :
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.
 :
Martin, would you talk to him?
MARTIN:

Barry, I'm talking to you!
(Barry keeps sinking into the honey until he is suddenly in Central Park
having a picnic with Vanessa)
(Barry has a cup of honey and he clinks his glass with Vanessas. Suddenly a
mosquito lands on Vanessa and she slaps it, killing it. They both gasp but
then burst out laughing)
VANESSA:
You coming?
(The camera pans over and Vanessa is climbing into a small yellow airplane)
BARRY:
Got everything?
VANESSA:
All set!
BARRY:
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
(Vanessa lifts off and flies ahead)
VANESSA:
Don't be too long.
(Barry catches up with Vanessa and he sticks out his arms like ana irplane.
He rolls from side to side, and Vanessa copies him with the airplane)
VANESSA:
Watch this!
(Barry stays back and watches as Vanessa draws a heart in the air using
pink smoke from the plane, but on the last loop-the-loop she suddenly
crashes into a mountain and the plane explodes. The destroyed plane falls
into some rocks and explodes a second time)
BARRY:
Vanessa!
(As Barry is yelling his mouth fills with honey and he wakes up,
discovering that he was just day dreaming. He slowly sinks back into the
honey pool)
MARTIN:
- We're still here.

JANET:
- I told you not to yell at him.
 :
He doesn't respond to yelling!
MARTIN:
- Then why yell at me?
JANET:
- Because you don't listen!
MARTIN:
I'm not listening to this.
BARRY:
Sorry, I've gotta go.
MARTIN:
- Where are you going?
BARRY:
- I'm meeting a friend.
JANET:
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
BARRY:
Bye.
(Barry flies out the door and Martin shakes his head)
 :
JANET==
I just hope she's Bee-ish.
(Fast forward in time and Barry is sitting on Vanessa's shoulder and she is
closing up her shop)
BARRY:
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?
VANESSA:
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

 :
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.
BARRY:
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?
VANESSA:
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?
BARRY:
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.
VANESSA:
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.
BARRY:
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!
VANESSA:
You don't have that?
BARRY:
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.
VANESSA:
Oh, my.
(A human walks by and Barry narrowly avoids him)
PASSERBY:
Dumb bees!
VANESSA:
You must want to sting all those jerks.
BARRY:
We try not to sting.

It's usually fatal for us.
VANESSA:
So you have to watch your temper
(They walk into a store)
BARRY:
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,
 :
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:
 :
Anger, jealousy, lust.
(Suddenly an employee(Hector) hits Barry off of Vanessa's shoulder. Hector
thinks he's saving Vanessa)
VANESSA:
(To Barry)
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
(Barry is getting up off the floor)
BARRY:
Yeah.
VANESSA:
(To Hector)
- What is wrong with you?!
HECTOR:
(Confused)
- It's a bug.
VANESSA:
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!
(Vanessa hits Hector across the face with the magazine he had and then hits
him in the head. Hector backs away covering his head)
Barry:
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
(Vanessa sets Barry back on her shoulder)

VANESSA:
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
BARRY:
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
VANESSA:
You've really got that
down to a science.
BARRY:
- Oh, we have to. I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
VANESSA:
- I'll bet.
(Barry looks to his right and notices there is honey for sale in the aisle)
BARRY:
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?
(Barry looks at all the brands of honey, shocked)
How did this get here?
Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,
 :
Ray Liotta Private Select?
(Barry puts his hands up and slowly turns around, a look of disgust on his
face)
VANESSA:
- Is he that actor?
BARRY:
- I never heard of him.
 :
- Why is this here?
VANESSA:
- For people. We eat it.
BARRY:

You don't have
enough food of your own?!
(Hector looks back and notices that Vanessa is talking to Barry)
VANESSA:
- Well, yes.
BARRY:
- How do you get it?
VANESSA:
- Bees make it.
BARRY:
- I know who makes it!
 :
And it's hard to make it!
 :
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!
VANESSA:
- It's organic.
BARRY:
- It's our-ganic!
VANESSA:
It's just honey, Barry.
BARRY:
Just what?!
 :
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
 :
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!
 :

And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.
 :
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!
(Flash forward in time; Barry paints his face with black strikes like a
soldier and sneaks into the storage section of the store)
(Two men, including Hector, are loading boxes into some trucks)
 :
SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE==
Hey, Hector.
 :
- You almost done?
HECTOR:
- Almost.
(Barry takes a step to peak around the corner)
(Whispering)
He is here. I sense it.
 :
Well, I guess I'll go home now
(Hector pretends to walk away by walking in place and speaking loudly)
 :
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.
BARRY:
You're busted, box boy!
HECTOR:
I knew I heard something!
So you can talk!
BARRY:
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!
 :
Where you getting the sweet stuff?

Who's your supplier?
HECTOR:
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
 :
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!
(Hector takes a thumbtack out of the board behind him and sword-fights
Barry. Barry is using his stinger like a sword)
 :
You're too late! It's ours now!
BARRY:
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!
HECTOR:
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!
(Barry hits the thumbtack out of Hectors hand and Hector surrenders)
Barry:
Where is the honey coming from?
 :
Tell me where!
HECTOR:
(Pointing to leaving truck)
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
(Barry chases after the truck but it is getting away. He flies onto a
bicyclists' backpack and he catches up to the truck)
CAR DRIVER:
(To bicyclist)
Crazy person!
(Barry flies off and lands on the windshield of the Honey farms truck.
Barry looks around and sees dead bugs splattered everywhere)
BARRY:
What horrible thing has happened here?

 :
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now
 :
they're on the road to nowhere!
(Barry hears a sudden whisper)
(Barry looks up and sees Mooseblood, a mosquito playing dead)
MOOSEBLOOD:
Just keep still.
BARRY:
What? You're not dead?
MOOSEBLOOD:
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?
BARRY:
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.
MOOSEBLOOD:
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
ANOTHER BUG PLAYING DEAD:
I'm going to Tacoma.
(Barry looks at another bug)
BARRY:
- And you?
MOOSEBLOOD:
- He really is dead.
BARRY:
All right.
(Another bug hits the windshield and the drivers notice. They activate the
windshield wipers)
MOOSEBLOOD==
Uh-oh!
(The windshield wipers are slowly sliding over the dead bugs and wiping

them off)
BARRY:
- What is that?!
MOOSEBLOOD:
- Oh, no!
 :
- A wiper! Triple blade!
BARRY:
- Triple blade?
MOOSEBLOOD:
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
(Mooseblood and Barry grab onto the wiper and they hold on as it wipes the
windshield)
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!
 :
How much do you people need to see?!
(Bangs on windshield)
 :
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!
RADIO IN TRUCK:
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Carl Kasell.
MOOSEBLOOD:
But don't kill no more bugs!
(Mooseblood and Barry are washed off by the wipr fluid)
MOOSEBLOOD:
- Bee!
BARRY:
- Moose blood guy!!
(Barry starts screaming as he hangs onto the antenna)
(Suddenly it is revealed that a water bug is also hanging on the antenna.

There is a pause and then Barry and the water bug both start screaming)
TRUCK DRIVER:
- You hear something?
GUY IN TRUCK:
- Like what?
TRUCK DRIVER:
Like tiny screaming.
GUY IN TRUCK:
Turn off the radio.
(The antenna starts to lower until it gets to low and sinks into the truck.
The water bug flies off and Barry is forced to let go and he is blown away.
He luckily lands inside a horn on top of the truck where he finds
Mooseblood, who was blown into the same place)
MOOSEBLOOD:
Whassup, bee boy?
BARRY:
Hey, Blood.
(Fast forward in time and we see that Barry is deep in conversation with
Mooseblood. They have been sitting in this truck for a while)
BARRY:
...Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.
MOOSEBLOOD:
Wow!
BARRY:
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.
 :
I mean, that honey's ours.
MOOSEBLOOD:
- Bees hang tight.
BARRY:

- We're all jammed in.
 :
It's a close community.
MOOSEBLOOD:
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.
BARRY:
- What if you get in trouble?
MOOSEBLOOD:
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.
 :
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!
BARRY:
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.
MOOSEBLOOD:
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.
 :
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
(An ambulance passes by and it has a blood donation sign on it)
You got to be kidding me!
 :
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!
(Mooseblood leaves and flies onto the window of the ambulance where there
are other mosquito's hanging out)
 :
- Hey, guys!
OTHER MOSQUITO:
- Mooseblood!

MOOSEBLOOD:
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?
(The truck goes out of view and Barry notices that the truck he's on is
pulling into a camp of some sort)
TRUCK DRIVER:
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.
(Barry flies out)
BARRY:
What is this place?
BEEKEEPER 1#:
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.
BEEKEEPER #2:
They are pinheads!
 :
Pinhead.
 :
- Check out the new smoker.
BEEKEEPER #1:
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
 :
The Thomas 3000!
BARRY:
Smoker?
BEEKEEPER #1:
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
 :
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

BEEKEEPER #2:
They make the honey,
and we make the money.
BARRY:
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?
(The Beekeeper sprays hundreds of cheap miniature apartments with the
smoker. The bees are fainting or passing out)
Oh, my!
 :
What's going on? Are you OK?
(Barry flies into one of the apartment and helps a Bee couple get off the
ground. They are coughing and its hard for them to stand)
BEE IN APARTMENT:
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
BARRY:
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?
BEE IN APPARTMENT:
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.
(The apartment room is completely empty except for a photo on the wall of
the "queen" who is obviously a man in women's clothes)
BARRY:
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!
 :
That's a drag queen!
 :
What is this?
(Barry flies out and he discovers that there are hundreds of these
structures, each housing thousands of Bees)
Oh, no!
 :
There's hundreds of them!
(Barry takes out his camera and takes pictures of these Bee work camps. The
beekeepers look very evil in these depictions)

Bee honey.
 :
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!
 :
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.
(Flash forward in time and Barry is showing these pictures to his parents)
JANET:
Oh, Barry, stop.
MARTIN:
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.
BARRY:
Do these look like rumors?
(Holds up the pictures)
UNCLE CARL:
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.
JANET:
How did you get mixed up in this?
ADAM:
He's been talking to humans.
JANET:
- What?
MARTIN:
- Talking to humans?!
ADAM:
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!
JANET:
Make out? Barry!

BARRY:
We do not.
ADAM:
- You wish you could.
MARTIN:
- Whose side are you on?
BARRY:
The bees!
UNCLE CARL:
(He has been sitting in the back of the room this entire time)
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
JANET:
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?
BARRY:
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!
 :
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked
 :
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.
JANET:
I remember that.
BARRY:
What right do they have to our honey?
 :
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

ADAM:
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
BARRY:
Sting them where it really hurts.
MARTIN:
In the face! The eye!
 :
- That would hurt.
BARRY:
- No.
MARTIN:
Up the nose? That's a killer.
BARRY:
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.
(Flash forward a bit in time and we are watching the Bee News)
BEE NEWS NARRATOR:
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.
BEE PROTESTOR:
No more bee beards!
BEE NEWS NARRATOR:
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
 :
Weather with Storm Stinger.
 :
Sports with Buzz Larvi.
 :
And Jeanette Chung.
BOB BUMBLE:
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
JEANETTE CHUNG:

- And I'm Jeanette Chung.
BOB BUMBLE:
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,
 :
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,
 :
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!
JEANETTE CHUNG:
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
 :
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,
 :
Classy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.
(The scene changes to an interview on the news with Bee version of Larry
King and Barry)
BEE LARRY KING:
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
 :
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?
BARRY:
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.
 :
What about Bee Columbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
BEE LARRY KING:
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

 :
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.
BARRY:
How old are you?
BEE LARRY KING:
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,
 :
which will be the trial
of the bee century.
BARRY:
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.
BEE LARRY KING:
It's a common name. Next week...
BARRY:
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...
BEE LARRY KING:
Next week...
BARRY:
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.
BEE LARRY KING:
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here, live.
(Bee Larry King gets annoyed and flies away offscreen)
BARRY:
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.
(Flash forward in time. We see Vanessa enter and Ken enters behind her.
They are arguing)

KEN:
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!
VANESSA:
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
KEN==
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
BARRY:
(To Ken)
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.
KEN:
(Pointing at Barry)
- Is that that same bee?
VANESSA:
- Yes, it is!
 :
I'm helping him sue the human race.
BARRY:
- Hello.
KEN:
- Hello, bee.
VANESSA:
This is Ken.
BARRY:
(Recalling the "Winter Boots" incident earlier)
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
KEN:
(To Vanessa)
Why does he talk again?
VANESSA:

Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.
KEN:
But it's our yogurt night!
VANESSA:
(Holding door open for Ken)
Bye-bye.
KEN:
(Yelling)
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
(Ken leaves and Vanessa walks over to Barry. His workplace is a mess)
VANESSA:
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!
BARRY:
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.
ADAM:
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?
 ==BARRY==
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.
 :
So why are you helping me?
VANESSA:
Bees have good qualities.
 :
And it takes my mind off the shop.
 :
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.
BARRY:

Those are great, if you're three.
VANESSA:
And artificial flowers.
BARRY:
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
VANESSA:
- Yeah, me too.
 :
BARRY:
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
ADAM:
Bees must hate those fake things!
 :
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.
 :
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.
VANESSA:
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
BARRY:
- I guess.
ADAM:
You sure you want to go through with it?
BARRY:
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able
 :
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!
(Flash forward in time and we are watching the human news. The camera shows

a crowd outside a courthouse)
NEWS REPORTER:
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,
 :
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,
 :
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.
(We are no longer watching through a news camera)
ADAM:
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
BARRY:
It's pretty big, isn't it?
ADAM==
(Looking at the hundreds of people around the courthouse)
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.
BARRY:
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?
SECURITY GUARD:
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.
(A limousine drives up and a fat man,Layton Montgomery, a honey industry
owner gets out and walks past Barry)
ADAM:
- What's the matter?
BARRY:
- I don't know, I just got a chill.
(Fast forward in time and everyone is in the court)
MONTGOMERY:
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

(To Honey Industry lawyers)
You boys work on this?
MAN:
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
All right. Case number 4475,
 :
Superior Court of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry
 :
is now in session.
 :
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?
MONTGOMERY:
A privilege.
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?
(Everyone looks closely, they are waiting to see if a Bee can really talk)
(Barry makes several buzzing sounds to sound like a Bee)
BARRY:
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.
JUDGE BUMBLBETON:
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.
MONTGOMERY:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
 :
my grandmother was a simple woman.
 :

Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right
 :
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.
 :
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,
 :
just think of what would it mean.
 :
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm
 :
for the elastic in my britches!
 :
Talking bee!
(Montgomery walks over and looks closely at Barry)
 :
How do we know this isn't some sort of
 :
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?
 :
They could be using laser beams!
 :
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Cloning! For all we know,
 :
he could be on steroids!
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
Mr. Benson?

BARRY:
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.
 :
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.
 :
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!
 :
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.
 :
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room
 :
who think they can take it from us
 :
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,
 :
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have
 :
but everything we are!
JANET==
(To Martin)
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
Call your first witness.
BARRY:
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden

of Honey Farms, big company you have.
KLAUSS VANDERHAYDEN:
I suppose so.
BARRY:
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!
KLAUSS:
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.
BARRY:
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.
 :
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?
KLAUSS:
(Quietly)
- No.
BARRY:
- I couldn't hear you.
KLAUSS:
- No.
BARRY:
- No.
 :
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,
 :
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
KLAUSS:
They're very lovable creatures.

 :
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
BARRY:
You mean like this?
(The bear from Over The Hedge barges in through the back door and it is
roaring and standing on its hind legs. It is thrashing its claws and people
are screaming. It is being held back by a guard who has the bear on a
chain)
 :
(Pointing to the roaring bear)
Bears kill bees!
 :
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!
 :
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
OK, that's enough. Take him away.
(The bear stops roaring and thrashing and walks out)
BARRY:
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.
 :
- Where have I heard it before?
MR. STING:
- I was with a band called The Police.
BARRY:
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?
STING:
No, I haven't.
BARRY:

No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example
 :
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human
 :
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.
STING:
Oh, please.
BARRY:
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
 :
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.
 :
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
MONTGOMERY:
That's not his real name?! You idiots!
BARRY:
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on
 :
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.
RAY LIOTTA:
Thank you. Thank you.
BARRY:
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome
 :
with a churning inner turmoil

that's ready to blow.
RAY LIOTTA:
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
BARRY:
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?
 :
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't
 :
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?
RAY LIOTTA:
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!
BARRY:
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!
(Ray Liotta looses it and tries to grab Barry)
RAY LIOTTA:
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
- Order in this court!
RAY LIOTTA:
- You're all thinking it!
(Judge Bumbleton starts banging her gavel)
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
Order! Order, I say!
RAY LIOTTA:
- Say it!
MAN:

- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
(We see a montage of magazines which feature the court case)
(Flash forward in time and Barry is back home with Vanessa)
BARRY:
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.
VANESSA:
I think the jury's on our side.
BARRY:
Are we doing everything right,you know, legally?
VANESSA:
I'm a florist.
BARRY:
Right. Well, here's to a great team.
VANESSA:
To a great team!
(Ken walks in from work. He sees Barry and he looks upset when he sees
Barry clinking his glass with Vanessa)
KEN:
Well, hello.
VANESSA:
- Oh, Ken!
BARRY:
- Hello!
VANESSA:
I didn't think you were coming.
 :
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but...
(Ken holds up his phone and flips it open. The phone has no charge)
...the battery...
VANESSA:

I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
KEN:
Oh, that was lucky.
(Ken sits down at the table across from Barry and Vanessa leaves the room)
VANESSA:
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.
KEN:
(Not taking his eyes off Barry)
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
BARRY:
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
 :
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.
KEN:
That's where I usually sit.
Right...
(Points to where Barry is sitting)
there.
VANESSA:
(Calling from other room)
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,
 :
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
KEN:
(To Barry)
You think I don't see what you're doing?
BARRY:
I know how hard it is to find
the right job. We have that in common.

KEN:
Do we?
BARRY:
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
KEN:
(Menacingly)
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.
(Ken reaches for a fork on the table but knocks if on the floor. He goes to
pick it up)
VANESSA:
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
(Ken quickly rises back up after hearing this but hits his head on the
table and yells)
BARRY:
I'm going to drain the old stinger.
KEN:
Yeah, you do that.
(Barry flies past Ken to get to the bathroom and Ken freaks out, splashing
some of the wine he was using to cool his head in his eyes. He yells in
anger)
(Barry looks at the magazines featuring his victories in court)
BARRY:
Look at that.
(Barry flies into the bathroom)
(He puts his hand on his head but this makes hurts him and makes him even
madder. He yells again)
(Barry is washing his hands in the sink but then Ken walks in)
KEN:
You know, you know I've just about had it
(Closes bathroom door behind him)
with your little mind games.
(Ken is menacingly rolling up a magazine)
BARRY:

(Backing away)
- What's that?
KEN:
- Italian Vogue.
BARRY:
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
KEN:
It's a lot of ads.
BARRY:
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?
KEN:
That's funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
(Ken smashes everything off the sink with the magazine and Barry narrowly
escapes)
(Ken follows Barry around and tries to hit him with the magazine but he
keeps missing)
(Ken gets a spray bottle)
 :
I think something stinks in here!
BARRY:
(Enjoying the spray)
I love the smell of flowers.
(Ken holds a lighter in front of the spray bottle)
KEN:
How do you like the smell of flames?!
BARRY:
Not as much.
(Ken fires his make-shift flamethrower but misses Barry, burning the
bathroom. He torches the whole room but looses his footing and falls into
the bathtub. After getting hit in the head by falling objects 3 times he
picks up the shower head, revealing a Water bug hiding under it)
WATER BUG:
Water bug! Not taking sides!

(Barry gets up out of a pile of bathroom supplies and he is wearing a
chapstick hat)
BARRY:
Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!
This is pathetic!
(Ken switches the shower head to lethal)
KEN:
I've got issues!
(Ken sprays Barry with the shower head and he crash lands into the toilet)
(Ken menacingly looks down into the toilet at Barry)
Well, well, well, a royal flush!
BARRY:
- You're bluffing.
KEN:
- Am I?
(flushes toilet)
(Barry grabs a chapstick from the toilet seat and uses it to surf in the
flushing toilet)
BARRY:
Surf's up, dude!
(Barry flies out of the toilet on the chapstick and sprays Ken's face with
the toilet water)
 :
EW,Poo water!
BARRY:
That bowl is gnarly.
KEN:
(Aiming a toilet cleaner at Barry)
Except for those dirty yellow rings!
(Barry cowers and covers his head and Vanessa runs in and takes the toilet
cleaner from Ken just before he hits Barry)
VANESSA:
Kenneth! What are you doing?!
KEN==
(Leaning towards Barry)

You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!
VANESSA:
We need to talk!
(Vanessa pulls Ken out of the bathroom)
 :
He's just a little bee!
 :
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
KEN:
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?
VANESSA:
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!
KEN:
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
 :
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!
VANESSA:
Goodbye, Ken.
(Ken huffs and walks out and slams the door. But suddenly he walks back in
and stares at Barry)
 :
And for your information,
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners MADE BY MAN!
(Ken leaves again and Vanessa leans in towards Barry)
VANESSA:
I'm sorry about all that.
(Ken walks back in again)

KEN:
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I LIKE IT!
(Ken leaves for the last time)
VANESSA:
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.
 :
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.
 :
Are you OK for the trial?
BARRY:
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.
(Flash forward in time and Barry, Adam, and Vanessa are back in court)
MONTGOMERY--
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
ADAM:
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...
(Barry stares at Adam)
...Yeah.
LAWYER:
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.
MONTGOMERY:
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around
 :
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.
(To lawyer)

- You got the tweezers?
LAWYER:
- Are you allergic?
MONTGOMERY:
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
 :
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.
 :
What exactly is your relationship
(Points to Vanessa)
 :
to that woman?
BARRY:
We're friends.
MONTGOMERY:
- Good friends?
BARRY:
- Yes.
MONTGOMERY:
How good? Do you live together?
ADAM:
Wait a minute...
 :
MONTGOMERY:
Are you her little...
 :
...bedbug?
(Adam's stinger starts vibrating. He is agitated)
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

 :
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?
BARRY:
- Yeah, but...
MONTGOMERY:
(Pointing at Janet and Martin)
- So those aren't your real parents!
JANET:
- Oh, Barry...
BARRY:
- Yes, they are!
ADAM:
Hold me back!
(Vanessa tries to hold Adam back. He wants to sting Montgomery)
MONTGOMERY:
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?
ADAM:
He's denouncing bees!
MONTGOMERY:
Don't y'all date your cousins?
(Montgomery leans over on the jury stand and stares at Adam)
VANESSA:
- Objection!
(Vanessa raises her hand to object but Adam gets free. He flies straight at
Montgomery)
=ADAM:
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!
BARRY:
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
(Adam stings Montgomery in the butt and he starts thrashing around)

MONTGOMERY:
Oh, I'm hit!!
 :
Oh, lordy, I am hit!
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
(Banging gavel)
Order! Order!
MONTGOMERY:
(Overreacting)
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!
 :
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!
 :
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!
 :
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!
BARRY:
- Adam, stay with me.
ADAM:
- I can't feel my legs.
MONTGOMERY:
(Overreacting and throwing his body around the room)
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison
 :
from my heaving buttocks?
JUDGE BUMLBETON:
I will have order in this court. Order!

 :
Order, please!
(Flash forward in time and we see a human news reporter)
NEWS REPORTER:
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race
 :
took a pointed turn against the bees
 :
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
(Adam is laying in a hospital bed and Barry flies in to see him)
BARRY:
- Hey, buddy.
ADAM:
- Hey.
BARRY:
- Is there much pain?
ADAM:
- Yeah.
 :
I...
 :
I blew the whole case, didn't I?
BARRY:
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.
ADAM:
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
(A small plastic sword is replaced as Adam's stinger)
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

 :
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.
(Flicks off the celery and sighs)
BARRY:
What was it like to sting someone?
ADAM:
I can't explain it. It was all...
 :
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!
BARRY:
...All right.
ADAM:
You think it was all a trap?
BARRY:
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.
 :
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.
ADAM:
What will the humans do to us
if they win?
BARRY:
I don't know.
ADAM:
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.
BARRY:
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

ADAM:
Oh, my.
(Coughs)
Could you get a nurse
to close that window?
BARRY:
- Why?
ADAM:
- The smoke.
(We can see that two humans are smoking cigarettes outside)
 :
Bees don't smoke.
BARRY:
Right. Bees don't smoke.
 :
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.
 :
That's it! That's our case!
ADAM:
It is? It's not over?
BARRY:
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
 :
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.
(Flash forward in time and Adam is making a paper boat in the courtroom)
ADAM:
And assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub!
(We see that the jury have each made their own paper boats after being
taught how by Adam. They all look confused)
JUDGE BUMBLETON:

Mr. Flayman.
ADAM:
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
Where is the rest of your team?
ADAM:
(Continues stalling)
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
 :
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,
 :
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.
 :
I actually heard a funny story about...
MONTGOMERY:
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs
 :
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?
 :
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?
 :
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges
 :
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.
 :
I move for a complete dismissal

of this entire case!
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
 :
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.
ADAM:
But you can't! We have a terrific case.
MONTGOMERY:
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?
 :
Show me the smoking gun!
BARRY:
(Barry flies in through the door)
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?
 :
Here is your smoking gun.
(Vanessa walks in holding a bee smoker. She sets it down on the Judge's
podium)
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
What is that?
BARRY:
It's a bee smoker!
MONTGOMERY:
(Picks up smoker)
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?
 :
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.
(Montgomery accidentally fires it at the bees in the crowd and they faint

and cough)
(Dozens of reporters start taking pictures of the suffering bees)
BARRY:
Look at what has happened
 :
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"
 :
Is this what nature intended for us?
 :
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines
 :
and man-made wooden slat work camps?
 :
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?
(Barry points to the honey industry owners. One of them is an African
American so he awkwardly separates himself from the others)
LAWYER:
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.
BARRY:
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!
ADAM AND VANESSA:
Free the bees! Free the bees!
BEES IN CROWD:
Free the bees!
HUMAN JURY:
Free the bees! Free the bees!
JUDGE BUMBLETON:
The court finds in favor of the bees!

BARRY:
Vanessa, we won!
VANESSA:
I knew you could do it! High-five!
(Vanessa hits Barry hard because her hand is too big)
 :
Sorry.
BARRY:
(Overjoyed)
I'm OK! You know what this means?
 :
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.
 :
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.
MONTGOMERY:
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.
 :
You'll regret this.
(Montgomery leaves and Barry goes outside the courtroom. Several reporters
start asking Barry questions)
REPORTER 1#:
Barry, how much honey is out there?
BARRY:
All right. One at a time.
REPORTER 2#:
Barry, who are you wearing?
BARRY:
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

(Barry flies outside with the paparazzi and Adam and Vanessa stay back)
ADAM:
(To Vanessa)
- What if Montgomery's right?
Vanessa:
- What do you mean?
ADAM:
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.
(Flash forward in time and Barry is talking to a man)
BUSINESS MAN:
Congratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?
BARRY:
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.
(As Barry is talking we see a montage of men putting "closed" tape over the
work camps and freeing the bees in the crappy apartments)
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,
 :
every last drop.
(Men in suits are pushing all the honey of the aisle and into carts)
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more
(We see a statue of a bear-shaped honey container being pulled down by
bees)
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.
 :
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.
(We see Winnie the Pooh sharing his honey with Piglet in the cross-hairs of
a high-tech sniper rifle)
BARRY:
(Looking through binoculars)

Wait for my signal.
 :
Take him out.
(Winnie gets hit by a tranquilizer dart and dramatically falls off the log
he was standing on, his tongue hanging out. Piglet looks at Pooh in fear
and the Sniper takes the honey.)
SNIPER:
He'll have nausea
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
(Flash forward in time)
BARRY:
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...
(Mr. Sting is sitting at home until he is taken out of his house by the men
in suits)
STING:
But it's just a prance-about stage name!
BARRY:
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products
 :
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.
(An old lady is mixing honey into her tea but suddenly men in suits smash
her face down on the table and take the honey)
OLD LADY:
Can't breathe.
(A honey truck pulls up to Barry's hive)
WORKER:
Bring it in, boys!
 :
Hold it right there! Good.
 :
Tap it.

(Tons of honey is being pumped into the hive's storage)
BEE WORKER 1#:
(Honey overflows from the cup)
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!
 :
- I think we need to shut down!
=BEE WORKER #2=
- Shut down? We've never shut down.
 :
Shut down honey production!
DEAN BUZZWELL:
Stop making honey!
(The bees all leave their stations. Two bees run into a room and they put
the keys into a machine)
Turn your key, sir!
(Two worker bees dramatically turn their keys, which opens the button which
they press, shutting down the honey-making machines. This is the first time
this has ever happened)
BEE:
...What do we do now?
(Flash forward in time and a Bee is about to jump into a pool full of
honey)
Cannonball!
(The bee gets stuck in the honey and we get a short montage of Bees leaving
work)
(We see the Pollen Jocks flying but one of them gets a call on his antenna)
LOU LU DUVA:
(Through "phone")
We're shutting honey production!
 :
Mission abort.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.
(The Pollen Jocks fly back to the hive)

(We get a time lapse of Central Park slowly wilting away as the bees all
relax)
BARRY:
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.
ADAM:
Oh, yeah?
BARRY:
What's going on? Where is everybody?
(The entire street is deserted)
 :
- Are they out celebrating?
ADAM:
- They're home.
 :
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.
 :
I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.
BARRY:
At least we got our honey back.
ADAM:
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
 :
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.
 :
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.
 :

And now...
 :
Now I can't.
(Flash forward in time and Barry is talking to Vanessa)
BARRY:
I don't understand
why they're not happy.
 :
I thought their lives would be better!
 :
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.
VANESSA:
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?
BARRY:
- What did you want to show me?
(Vanessa takes Barry to the rooftop where they first had coffee and points
to her store)
VANESSA:
- This.
(Points at her flowers. They are all grey and wilting)
BARRY:
What happened here?
VANESSA:
That is not the half of it.
(Small flash forward in time and Vanessa and Barry are on the roof of her
store and she points to Central Park)
(We see that Central Park is no longer green and colorful, rather it is
grey, brown, and dead-like. It is very depressing to look at)
BARRY:
Oh, no. Oh, my.
 :

They're all wilting.
VANESSA:
Doesn't look very good, does it?
BARRY:
No.
VANESSA:
And whose fault do you think that is?
BARRY:
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
VANESSA==
(Staring at Barry)
Bees?
BARRY:
Specifically, me.
 :
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.
VANESSA:
It's not just flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
BARRY:
That's our whole SAT test right there.
VANESSA:
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.
 :
And then, of course...
BARRY:
The human species?
 :
So if there's no more pollination,

 :
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?
VANESSA:
I know this is also partly my fault.
BARRY:
How about a suicide pact?
VANESSA:
How do we do it?
BARRY:
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
VANESSA:
- That just kills you twice.
BARRY:
Right, right.
VANESSA:
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.
(Vanessa leaves)
BARRY:
(To himself)
I had to open my mouth and talk.
 :
Vanessa?
 :
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?
(Vanessa is getting into a taxi)
VANESSA:
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.
 :

They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.
 :
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.
BARRY:
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.
VANESSA:
I know. Me neither.
(The taxi starts to drive away)
BARRY:
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.
 :
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
 :
Roses!
 :
Vanessa!
(Barry flies after the Taxi)
VANESSA:
Roses?!
 :
Barry?
(Barry is flying outside the window of the taxi)
BARRY:
- Roses are flowers!
VANESSA:
- Yes, they are.
BARRY:
Flowers, bees, pollen!

VANESSA:
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.
BARRY:
Maybe not.
Could you ask him to slow down?
VANESSA:
Could you slow down?
(The taxi driver screeches to a stop and Barry keeps flying forward)
 :
Barry!
(Barry flies back to the window)
BARRY:
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.
VANESSA:
Yes, it kind of is.
BARRY:
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you
 :
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.
VANESSA:
Actually, it's completely closed down.
BARRY:
I thought maybe you were remodeling.
 :
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.
VANESSA:
I don't want to hear it!

BARRY:
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.
 :
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.
 :
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.
 :
- Bees.
VANESSA:
- Park.
BARRY:
- Pollen!
VANESSA:
- Flowers.
BARRY:
- Re-pollination!
VANESSA:
- Across the nation!
 :
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, California.
 :
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
 :
Security will be tight.
BARRY:
I have an idea.

(Flash forward in time. Vanessa is about to board a plane which has all the
Roses on board.
VANESSA:
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
(Holds out badge)
 :
Official floral business. It's real.
SECURITY GUARD:
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
=VANESSA==
Thank you. It was a gift.
(Barry is revealed to be hiding inside the brooch)
(Flash back in time and Barry and Vanessa are discussing their plan)
BARRY:
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.
VANESSA:
How about The Princess and the Pea?
 :
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!
BARRY:
Yes, I got it.
 :
- Where should I sit?
GUARD:
- What are you?
BARRY:
- I believe I'm the pea.
GUARD:
- The pea?
VANESSA:

It goes under the mattresses.
GUARD:
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.
VANESSA:
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!
 :
Let's see what this baby'll do.
(Vanessa drives the float through traffic)
GUARD:
Hey, what are you doing?!
BARRY==
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...
 :
...without arousing suspicion.
 :
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.
(Flash forward in time and Barry and Vanessa are about to get on a plane)
SECURITY GUARD:
Stop! Security.
 :
- You and your insect pack your float?
VANESSA:
- Yes.
SECURITY GUARD:
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?
VANESSA:
- Yes.

SECURITY GUARD:
Would you remove your shoes?
(To Barry)
- Remove your stinger.
BARRY:
- It's part of me.
SECURITY GUARD:
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.
(Barry plotting with Vanessa)
BARRY:
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.
(Flash forward in time and Barry and Vanessa are flying on the plane)
Can you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!
VANESSA:
I think this is gonna work.
BARRY:
It's got to work.
CAPTAIN SCOTT:
(On intercom)
Attention, passengers,
this is Captain Scott.
 :
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.
 :
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.
VANESSA:
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.
BARRY:

I gotta get up there
and talk to them.
VANESSA==
Be careful.
(Barry flies right outside the cockpit door)
BARRY:
Can I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
(The flight attendant opens the door and walks out and Barry flies into the
cockpit unseen)
BARRY:
Captain, I'm in a real situation.
CAPTAIN SCOTT:
- What'd you say, Hal?
CO-PILOT HAL:
- Nothing.
(Scott notices Barry and freaks out)
CAPTAIN SCOTT:
Bee!
BARRY:
No,no,no, Don't freak out! My entire species...
(Captain Scott gets out of his seat and tries to suck Barry into a handheld
vacuum)
HAL:
(To Scott)
What are you doing?
(Barry lands on Hals hair but Scott sees him. He tries to suck up Barry but
instead he sucks up Hals toupee)
CAPTAIN SCOTT:
Uh-oh.
BARRY:
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!

HAL:
(Hal doesn't know Barry is on his head)
- Who's an attorney?
CAPTAIN SCOTT:
Don't move.
(Scott hits Hal in the face with the vacuum in an attempt to hit Barry. Hal
is knocked out and he falls on the life raft button which launches an
infalatable boat into Scott, who gets knocked out and falls to the floor.
They are both uncounscious.)
BARRY:
(To himself)
Oh, Barry.
BARRY:
(On intercom, with a Southern accent)
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.
 :
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?
(Vanessa looks confused)
(Normal accent)
...And please hurry!
(Vanessa opens the door and sees the life raft and the uncounscious pilots)
VANESSA:
What happened here?
BARRY:
I tried to talk to them, but
then there was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.
 :
Now one's bald, one's in a boat,
and they're both unconscious!
VANESSA:
...Is that another bee joke?
BARRY:

- No!
 :
No one's flying the plane!
BUD DITCHWATER:
(Through radio on plane)
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?
VANESSA:
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
BUD:
Where's the pilot?
VANESSA:
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.
BUD:
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?
BARRY:
As a matter of fact, there is.
BUD:
- Who's that?
BARRY:
- Barry Benson.
BUD:
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
BARRY:
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.
 :
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

VANESSA:
I can't fly a plane.
BARRY:
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
VANESSA:
- Yes.
BARRY:
How hard could it be?
(Vanessa sits down and flies for a little bit but we see lightning clouds
outside the window)
VANESSA:
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.
(An ominous lightning storm looms in front of the plane)
(We are now watching the Bee News)
BOB BUMBLE:
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
 :
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.
 :
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...
ADAM:
That's Barry!
BOB BUMBLE:
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers
 :
and an incapacitated flight crew.
JANET, MARTIN, UNCLE CAR AND ADAM:
Flowers?!
(The scene switches to the human news)

REPORTER:
(Talking with Bob Bumble)
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls
 :
with absolutely no flight experience.
BOB BUMBLE:
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.
BUD:
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.
 :
They've done enough damage.
REPORTER:
But isn't he your only hope?
BUD:
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.
 :
Their wings are too small...
BARRY:
(Through radio)
Haven't we heard this a million times?
 :
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."...
BOB BUMBLE:
- Get this on the air!
BEE:
- Got it.

BEE NEWS CREW:
- Stand by.
BEE NEWS CREW:
- We're going live!
BARRY:
(Through radio on TV)
...The way we work may be a mystery to you.
 :
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.
 :
But let me tell you about a small job.
 :
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.
 :
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.
 :
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.
 :
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.
 :
We get behind a fellow.
 :
- Black and yellow!
BEES:
- Hello!
(The scene switches and Barry is teaching Vanessa how to fly)
BARRY:

Left, right, down, hover.
VANESSA:
- Hover?
BARRY:
- Forget hover.
VANESSA:
This isn't so hard.
(Pretending to honk the horn)
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
(A Lightning bolt hits the plane and autopilot turns off)
Barry, what happened?!
BARRY:
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.
VANESSA:
- That may have been helping me.
BARRY:
- And now we're not!
VANESSA:
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
(The plane plummets but we see Lou Lu Duva and the Pollen Jocks, along with
multiple other bees flying towards the plane)
Lou Lu DUva:
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!
 :
Move out!
(The scene switches back to Vanessa and Barry in the plane)
BARRY:
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!
(Barry sticks out his arms like an airplane and flys in front of Vanessa's
face)

VANESSA:
Don't have to yell.
BARRY:
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.
VANESSA:
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!
BARRY:
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
VANESSA:
I can't do this!
(Barry slaps Vanessa)
BARRY:
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!
VANESSA:
(Slaps Barry)
You snap out of it.
BARRY:
(Slaps Vanessa)
 :
You snap out of it.
VANESSA:
- You snap out of it!
BARRY:
- You snap out of it!
(We see that all the Pollen Jocks are flying under the plane)
VANESSA:
- You snap out of it!
BARRY:
- You snap out of it!

VANESSA:
- You snap out of it!
BARRY:
- You snap out of it!
VANESSA:
- Hold it!
BARRY:
- Why? Come on, it's my turn.
VANESSA:
How is the plane flying?
(The plane is now safely flying)
VANESSA:
I don't know.
(Barry's antennae rings like a phone. Barry picks up)
BARRY:
Hello?
LOU LU DUVA:
(Through "phone")
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?
(All of the Pollen Jocks are carrying the plane)
BARRY:
The Pollen Jocks!
 :
They do get behind a fellow.
LOU LU DUVA:
- Black and yellow.
POLLEN JOCKS:
- Hello.
LOU LU DUVA:
All right, let's drop this tin can

on the blacktop.
BARRY:
Where? I can't see anything. Can you?
VANESSA:
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
 :
Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.
BARRY:
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.
(On the runway there are millions of bees laying on their backs)
BEES:
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
BARRY:
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.
VANESSA:
- What?
BARRY:
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
 :
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
 :
Bring the nose down.
BEES:
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR:
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
BUD:
- Get some lights on that!

(It is revealed that all the bees are organized into a giant pulsating
flower formation)
BEES:
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
BARRY:
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
VANESSA:
- OK.
BARRY:
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?
LOU LU DUVA:
Affirmative!
BARRY:
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
 :
Land on that flower!
 :
Ready? Full reverse!
 :
Spin it around!
(The plane's nose is pointed at a flower painted on a nearby plane)
- Not that flower! The other one!
VANESSA:
- Which one?
BARRY:
- That flower.
(The plane is now pointed at a fat guy in a flowered shirt. He freaks out
and tries to take a picture of the plane)
VANESSA:
- I'm aiming at the flower!

BARRY:
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower
made of millions of bees!
(The plane hovers over the bee-flower)
 :
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
 :
Rotate around it.
VANESSA:
- This is insane, Barry!
BARRY:
- This's the only way I know how to fly.
BUD:
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?
(The plane is unrealistically hovering and spinning over the bee-flower)
BARRY:
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!
 :
Just drop it. Be a part of it.
 :
Aim for the center!
 :
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
 :
Come on, already.
(The bees scatter and the plane safely lands)
VANESSA:
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

BARRY:
- Yes!
(Vanessa is about to high-five Barry)
No high-five!
VANESSA:
- Right.
ADAM:
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?
BARRY:
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!
ADAM:
- Thank you.
BARRY:
- But we're not done yet.
 :
Listen, everyone!
 :
This runway is covered
with the last pollen
 :
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.
 :
That means this is our last chance.
 :
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.
 :
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

 :
Are we going to be bees, or just
Museum of Natural History keychains?
BEES:
We're bees!
BEE WHO LIKES KEYCHAINS:
Keychain!
BARRY:
Then follow me! Except Keychain.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
Hold on, Barry. Here.
 :
You've earned this.
BARRY:
Yeah!
 :
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
(The Pollen Jocks throw Barry a nectar-collecting gun. Barry catches it)
Oh, yeah.
JANET:
That's our Barry.
(Barry and the Pollen Jocks get pollen from the flowers on the plane)
(Flash forward in time and the Pollen Jocks are flying over NYC)
 :
(Barry pollinates the flowers in Vanessa's shop and then heads to Central
Park)
BOY IN PARK:
Mom! The bees are back!
ADAM:
(Putting on his Krelman hat)
If anybody needs

to make a call, now's the time.
 :
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!
(The bee honey factories are back up and running)
(Meanwhile at Vanessa's shop)
VANESSA:
(To customer)
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Can I help who's next?
 :
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
(There is a room in the shop where Barry does legal work for other animals.
He is currently talking with a Cow)
COW:
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!
 :
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!
BARRY:
I had no idea.
VANESSA:
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?
BARRY:
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.
MOOSEBLOOD:
Sorry I'm late.
COW:
He's a lawyer too?

MOOSEBLOOD:
Ma'am, I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.
VANESSA:
Have a great afternoon!
 :
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.
BARRY:
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.
VANESSA:
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Can I help who's next?
BARRY:
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.
VANESSA:
Thank you, Barry!
(Ken walks by on the sidewalk and sees the "bee-approved honey" in
Vanessa's shop)
KEN:
That bee is living my life!!
ANDY:
Let it go, Kenny.
KEN:
- When will this nightmare end?!
ANDY:
- Let it all go.
BARRY:
- Beautiful day to fly.
POLLEN JOCK:

- Sure is.
BARRY:
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.
(Barry recreates the scene near the beginning of the movie where he flies
through the box kite. The movie fades to black and the credits being)
[--after credits; No scene can be seen but the characters can be heard
talking over the credits--]
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend!
 :
- Thinking bee!
- Me?
BARRY:
(Talking over singer)
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.
 :
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Can we stop here?
SINGER:
Oh, BarryBARRY:
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!
SINGER:
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.
BARRY:
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

MIKE: Abs, you ready?

Abby…

MIKE: Abs.

Come on. I know you’re in there. Let’s go.

Abby, come on.

Okay, okay.

You’re being a jerk.

You know I have somewhere I have to be.

Come on, let’s go. Five minutes.

I need you dressed.

(toy squeaks)

Five minutes.

(crowd chatter)

JEREMIAH: “And though the dreamer remains asleep, he walks through memory as if experiencing it for the first time anew, no longer a passenger but an active participant.”

(chuckles)

This stuff for real?

Some people think so.

Guess it depends on what you believe.

Summer of ’82, I traded a mint condition Cal Ripken Jr. rookie for a used copy of “Missile Command.”

That card’s probably worth 800 bucks now.

I wish I could participate in that memory and actively kick my own ass.

Can I keep it?

No.

WOMAN: I would like the walnut fudge, but I want the fudge on the side because I don’t want it to melt the ice cream.

And can I get some whipped cream on top and three cherries?

CINDY: Coming right up.

Hey.

You want your usual, right?

Uh, yeah.

So, when are you gonna bring your sister by?

We got this new flavor, Rainbow Explosion.

I bet she’ll go crazy for it.

Mike?

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

(grunts)

(crowd gasping, murmuring)

(grunting)

WOMAN (distantly): Number 27?

(echoing): Number 27?

(normal): Number 27?

Follow me.

(humming a tune quietly)

Mm.

What is your deal, Mike?

What are you, some kind of… head case?

You beat up a man in broad daylight.

In front of his child.

Daddy!

(people screaming)

(panting)

That was a mistake. Um…

It was a misunderstanding. I-I thought…

Just look at your employment record.

Tire Zone, sales associate, two months, terminated.

Insubordination.

Media World, custodial staff, one week.

It’s like you’re not even trying here, yet you sit before me asking for help.

I am just trying to figure out who you are, Mr. Michael Sh…

Hmm.

Coffee?

Sorry?

Uh, would you, would you like some… some coffee? I made some coffee.

No.

I’m-I’m gonna be brutally honest with you here, Mike.

Given your track record, your options… are gonna be extremely limited.

I’ll take anything, okay? Any-any job you got.

No. No.

Look, I-I-I get that part. Um, it’s just…

You know, it’s not that easy.

Yeah. Thank you.

I have a job for you.

Come on, sit down.

Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

Okay, uh, well, what is it?

It’s a security gig.

Full disclosure: it’s not great.

Right? High turnover.

That’s what we call it in the business, but you get to be your own boss. Sort of.

And you only have to worry about one thing.

Keeping people out.

And-and, you know, and keep the place tidy.

That’s two things.

You want the job or not?

How’s the pay?

Not great.

But the hours are worse.

(quietly): I can’t do nights.

Excuse me?

I can’t do nights.

(chuckles)

That’s such a shame.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Wait, uh…

In case you have a change of heart.


(music plays) (music plays)

MIKE: Hey, Max.

Thanks for babysitting.

There’s Stouffer’s.

Should still be warm if you’re hungry.

WOMAN (on TV): I have to tell you, there is something magical about these rings, and you can have it within…

I wish someone would buy me a ring.

Did Abby eat?

What do you think?

(humming a tune)

MAX: Same time tomorrow?

MIKE: Yep.

(continues humming)

What do we got?

Okay.

Well, that good-looking guy I recognize.

Who are all these other punks?

My friends. It’s not done yet.

Well, look, you can finish up after we eat, all right?

Come get some food.

I’m not hungry.

Abby, please, come eat.

Come on. Here. Please come.

No!

Come and…

Abs, with the day that I’m having, can you just eat some food?

You’re sitting on my friend.

You know what? I don’t care.

Do whatever you want.

But you should know what happens to little kids who don’t eat their dinners.

Their bodies stay the same size forever.

And they never get to ride the adult rides at the amusement park.

My friend says you’re an idiot.

Mm.

At least I’m real.

Everything’s better swimming in ketchup.

Right, Mike? Whoop.

I’m gonna go grab a towel.

Go watch your brother, okay?

Okay.

JANE: Just look at my nephew.

It’s not even 10:00

and he-he can barely keep his eyes open.

And this degenerate is who they entrust with the well-being of a mentally ill child.

Jane, like I’ve said before, Abby is not mentally ill.

Oh, right.

Perfectly normal to sit around drawing pictures all day and-and talking to magical creatures who do not exist.

Listen, I think we all just need to calm…

Don’t tell me to calm down.

You’re the doctor, and you’re making me feel like I’m the crazy one?

And after… after what he did to that poor man…

(crying): I just…

(Jane sobbing)

I have really tried to play nice. I have.

But I have to think about Abby now.

Enough is enough. Doug?

Doug.

(gasps) Oh.

JANE: In your heart, you know that this is the right thing to do.

I hope that you will sign.

And if I don’t?

Well, then, my lawyer and I will have to take you to court, where any judge with an ounce of sanity will see to it that you never see your sister again.

That what you want?

She-she doesn’t even care about Abby.

All she wants is the monthly check from the state.

(breathes deeply)

But, I mean, she-she has some good points, though.

I’m hardly fit to be raising a kid.

LILLIAN: I know a little girl who would strongly disagree.

MIKE: Come on.

She talks to air more than she talks to me.

I could drop dead tomorrow, and she’d be too busy drawing to even notice.

You know, pictures hold tremendous power for children.


Before we learn to speak, images are the most important tool we have for understanding the world around us.

What’s real, what matters to us most.

These are things children learn to communicate almost exclusively through pictures.

Yeah, her pictures mean something.

And who is at the center of nine out of ten of them?

Me.

Mm-hmm.

Like it or not, you’re her world.

MIKE: But what if it’s not up to me?

My aunt, she’s an idiot, but she’s right.

No judge in their right mind is ever gonna side with me.

Did you find a job yet?

Okay.

That would be a good place to start.

(whimsical music playing over TV)

(Mike sighs)

(pressing phone keys)

(line ringing)

STEVE (over phone): Hello.

Uh, hi.

Mr. Raglan, this is Mike.

Mr. “I can’t work nights.”

Right.

Uh, yeah, I was just calling to see if that job that you offered was, uh, was still available.

Oh, it absolutely is.

Why? Have you had a change of heart?

(TV continues playing quietly)

MIKE: How soon could I start?

(music plays) (music plays)

STEVE: Let me give you a little backstory.

This place was huge in the ’80s with the kids.

It’s been shut down for years.

The only reason they haven’t given it the old wrecking ball treatment is the owner’s a bit of a…

Well, he’s kind of a sentimental guy, I guess.

Just can’t bring himself to let it go yet.

(laughs)

Yeah.

Had some trouble with break-ins over the years.

Drunks and vagrants, mostly. Not ideal.

Security system’s dated but fully functional.

Floodlights on the outside, cameras inside and outside.

Fair warning: the electricity is a bit… iffy.

(glass crunching)

(music plays) (music plays)

Anything happens, there is a breaker in the main office.

Just flip it.

(machines powering up)

(lights clinking, buzzing)

Uh, I guess that’s about it.

You know… the rest is pretty easy.

Just keep your eyes on the monitors and… and keep people out.

Piece of cake.

(music plays) (music plays)

(sighs)

STEVE: So, I will catch you on the flip side.

Hopefully.

Welcome to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria, a magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life.

If you’re watching this video, it means you’ve been selected as Freddy’s newest security guard.

Congratulations.

We’re going to have so much fun together.

The genius who created Fazbear Entertainment opened Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria to indulge in his two greatest passions: family-friendly fun and cutting-edge animatronic technology.

Let’s introduce you to the stars of the show.

(laughs) Adorable, aren’t they?

Protecting these cuddly critters, and the proprietary technology that brings them to life, is now your sacred duty.

Keep them safe, and help ensure that Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria is here to delight, dazzle and entertain

So? How’d it go?

I should probably get out of here.

Hey, by the way, I-I do intend on-on paying you, eventually.

It’s okay.

I know where you live.

WAITER: Hey. Welcome to Sparky’s.

Could I set you folks up with some appetizers?

JEFF: Yes.

JANE: Oh.

We are not eating.

WAITER: (chuckles) Well, that’s no fun.

You do realize that lunch is the most important meal of the day?

JEFF: I thought it was breakfast.

Some people say that, but, you know, it’s just a theory. -Are you being paid by the word, or could we have a minute?

All right.

Thank you.

JANE: Ah, where were we?

Oh, you were about to tell me what a miserable failure you are.

JEFF: Hey, screw you, lady.

My sister went over every inch of that dump a thousand times.

If there was something to find, she would have found it.

Now pay up.

Uh, I’m sorry? (laughing)

JEFF: You said 200.

We had a deal.

Yeah, that you were gonna find me hard proof of criminal endangerment.

Instead, you’ve told me what a nice kid my niece is and that my nephew sleeps a lot.

He really does, though.

Sleeping is not a crime.

Is that guy okay?

I just realized I shouldn’t be hearing any of this.

As a matter of fact, I shouldn’t be here at all.

Sit down, Doug.

So, I guess we’re finished here, unless either one of you has a brilliant idea, which I realize is highly unlikely.

Why don’t we just kill him?

(Doug sighs)

Tempting. But no.

What else?

Mike was saying that… he really needs this new job to, like, look good on paper for the judge or something.

Well, that’s all very fascinating, honey, but I am not hearing a plan.

We toss the place.

Go on. -Well, he’s a security guard, right?

His job is to make sure nobody gets in.

So, we get in, and we mess up the place good.

We help ourselves to whatever we find along the way.

Your nephew gets canned.

Judge gives you the kid, and you give us…

$2,000.

One thousand.

But do it fast, and don’t mess it up.

I mean, you know, mess it up, but don’t… don’t mess this up.

(grunts)

Abby, do you need something?

No. -All right, quit playing and take that off.

I have to go to work.

I know. I’m coming with you.

No, you’re not.

Give me the vest.

No.

Give me the vest now.

I’m coming with you.

ABBY: I want to go with you.

MIKE: Abby.

I don’t want to stay here with Max. -Abby, stop.

Hello? -Abby, stop.

No! You can’t make me.

MIKE: Yes, I can.

No, it’s mine.

MAX: Hello?

(Abby screams)

Let go! (screams)

Let go. No, no.

MIKE: Abby, stop. Abby.

He’s taking my vest!

Abby.

No.

The new security guard.

Yeah.

You’re bleeding, by the way.

Looks nasty.

Come on. I know where they keep the first aid kit.

(thunder rumbling)

(chuckles): Love what you’ve done with the place.

Why Nebraska?

Oh, you need a hand?

I’m fine.

You sure?

Here.

I’m a certified EMT.

So if your heart ever goes out, I’m the one you want to call.

You seem to really know your way around the place.

Well, Freddy’s is on my beat.

I like to stay well-informed.

Also, I really loved this place as a kid.

There.

That should do it. (sighs)

Vanessa Shelly.

Mike.

Pleasure to meet you, Mike.

(drawer closes)

You doing all right this evening, Mike?

What?

Are you good? Are you okay?

Is everything copacetic?

Yeah, I know what “all right” means.

Do you also know that your eyes are bloodshot and your heart rate’s through the roof?

And aside from that gash on your arm, which… (chuckles) let’s be honest, is pretty frickin’ bizarre, you’ve been acting suspicious since the moment you opened the door.

Yeah, look, it’s been a weird night.

Sounds like Freddy’s.

This place, it gets to people.

It’s one of the reasons why you’re gonna quit.

I’m sorry?

Oh, yeah.

You security hires, you never last.

Have you met them yet?

Met who?

(lights buzzing)

(games beeping, whirring)

So, what are the other reasons?

Huh?

Why you think I’m gonna quit my job.

Well, you tell me.

Is this somewhere you see yourself ten, 20 years from now?

I mean, what do I know? Maybe the benefits are great.

(scoffs)

I didn’t think so.

Add to that the thing with those kids going missing.

And you’re not even wearing your badge.

It’s cool, huh?

(softly): Okay.

I’m trying my best, Abby, okay?

(objects clatter)

(on TV): Can’t you read?

You okay?

I made a mess.

I’m sorry.

They’re just… they’re just papers, all right?

They don’t… they don’t mean anything.

Then why do you have them?

Well, that’s complicated. Aunt Jane…

I hate her.

She’s mean and she smells like cigarettes.

(chuckles)

It’s not funny.

You’re right, it’s not. It’s just, uh…

I don’t know, it’s nice that we can finally agree about something.

Abs, no, I…

Hey. Vanessa.

Hey, Mike.

And hello.

Vanessa, this is Abby. Abby, Vanessa.

Hi, Abby.

Mike didn’t tell me he had a daughter.

Gross.

No, uh, Abby’s my sister.

Ah. Well, he didn’t tell me he had a sister either.

Are you here to arrest Mike?

MIKE: Okay, uh, can you go play in your room so me and Vanessa can talk?

It’s nice to meet you.

What, um… what are you doing here?

Somebody broke into Freddy’s.

What?

Wh-What-what happened?

Recognize these?

Look, it’s not what you think, okay?

Th-Those are… They’re sleeping pills.

They help me sleep.

I know what they are, Mike.

It’s written on the bottle.

News flash: If you’re too whacked out to remember to lock a friggin’ door, accident or not, you’re liable.

It’s called criminal negligence.

(scoffs) You wouldn’t understand.

Well, then help me.

‘Cause the moment I file that report, it’s out of my hands.

You want to take a walk?

So I used to have a brother.

His name was Garrett.

(sighs) And when I was… about 12, he was, uh, he was taken.

And I was there when it happened.

They never found the guy who did it, and they never found my brother.

So there’s this theory that, uh, we can’t forget things.


Basically, it says that every single thing that you see in your entire life, down to the tiniest of details, gets stored inside of you.

You just have to know how to look.

Your brother…

You think you saw who took him?

I know I did.

And I know that he’s in here, but he’s just… he’s…

It’s buried.

So every night, I dream, and I go back to that same memory, and I-I search for details.

For any little thing that got overlooked.

Yeah.

And that’s usually the part where people tell me I’m crazy.

I know what crazy looks like, Mike.

This isn’t it.

Not even close.

And these?

I mean, going back to the same dream, the same place night after night, it’s not easy, so the-the pills help.

Some other things, like familiar sights, familiar sounds.

“Pining for fun?”

(chuckles)

“Visit Nebraska.”

(laughs)

Your sister seems cool.

So it’s just the two of you?

Yeah.

Yeah, it’s just us.

Our mom died a little while back.

And Dad, he couldn’t handle it, so…

You know what’s crazy is, uh, when… when Garrett and I were kids, they were like those perfect parents you’d see on old TV shows.

Yeah, ev-every night, we would sit down together, we’d have family dinner, and we’d hold hands and say grace, and…

That actually sounds really nice.

Yeah, at the time, I thought it was really cheesy.

But then it’s gone.

You and Abby, you still have each other.

From where I sit, I’d say you’re lucky.

(indistinct police radio chatter)

(sighs) I should go.

No more sleeping on the job.

When you’re at Freddy’s, you stay alert.

MAX (recorded): Hey, it’s Max.

(chuckles) Leave a message. Or don’t.

(touch tones sounding)

(line ringing)

Come on, Max. Come on.

MAX (recorded): Hey, it’s Max. Leave a mes…

(sighs)

MIKE: I will work, and you will sleep, and under no circumstances are you gonna come out of my office.

Do you understand?

I understand.

This is not a vacation, okay? You’re not here to have fun.

Okay.

Whoa, slow down, slow down, slow down.

No, no, no.

Abby?

(soft creaking)

Whoa.

What happened?

Give me your hand.

Watch out.

I don’t know how it’s possible that you’re here like this in my dream, but…

I need your help.

Please.

Help me remember the man who took my brother.

If we show you, what will you give us?

Anything.

I’ll give you anything you want.

I mean…

Okay, good joke!

Congratulations! You got me!

You can come out now!

Hello?

It’s okay, Mike.

They just want to play.

(laughs softly)

We have to go home now. Come on.

Hold on.

They really like pictures.

(drawing on paper)

I had a lot of fun tonight.

Thank you for playing with me.

Hey, Abby, um, we need to talk about last night, okay?

Um…

So those, uh, those… machines…

My friends?

Your friends?

Um…

are they…?

Ghosts?

Yeah.

Of course.

How else could they make the robots move?

Right.

Can I have some more soup?

Yeah, sure.

Hey, Abs.

You know we used to have a brother, right?

Garrett.

I don’t… I don’t really talk about him very much.

Neither did Mom or Dad.

Yeah, it was hard for them.

It’s hard for me, too.

C-Can you explain this to me?

You-you drew that, right?

Okay, and… and-and you know what that is?

Hey, hey, it’s okay.

Okay, I’m not, I’m not mad.

I won’t get angry at you.

But I really need you to help me understand, please.

That’s when Garrett got taken.

Abby, who told you about that?

W-Was it a-a boy with blonde hair?

Did that boy ever tell you anything about the man driving that car?

Anything at all?

Okay, just think, think really hard, okay?

No.

All they talk about is a yellow rabbit.

Okay.

But…

I can ask.

I would really appreciate that.

Yeah.

My friends talk about her sometimes.

What do they say?

That she’s nice.

Abby, if I asked you to wait in the car, would you?

No.

Abby, wait.

ABBY: Guys, I’m back.

Abby.

Hey, Vanessa.

MIKE: Abby.

(Abby giggling)

Mike.

Vanessa.

(chuckles) I missed you guys.

MIKE: You knew about this.

Guess you figured it out.

Ghost children possessing giant robots?

Thanks for the heads-up.

Guys, we need help.

It needs to be big so we can all fit inside.

Abby, look.

Now, this is all really fun and exciting, but these things are big, and they could be dangerous, so I think we need to lay some ground rules, all right?

Vanessa, what do you think?

I think we could use the tables for the fort.

ABBY: Everyone, follow me.

I’ll, uh… I’ll-I’ll come with you.

(whispering): Abby, don’t forget to ask.

Okay.

Yeah.

(song ends)

What are you looking for exactly?

Tablecloths.

They used to keep ’em back here for big events.

Right. And remind me how you know that.

Found ’em.

(soft mechanical rattling)

VANESSA: Don’t.

I wouldn’t do that.

They’re spring locks.

They’re on all the older models.

They were designed to keep the animatronic parts in place so that, uh, a person could safely wear the suit.

They tend to be pretty unstable.

Let’s see.

Ooh.

Like I said, unstable.

Is there anything else that you want to tell me about, Vanessa?

‘Cause you seem to know everything about this place.

And what if Abby’d come in here?

What if she’d found that thing?

You’re the one who brought her, Mike, not me.

What I can’t wrap my head around is why.

All right, look.

I think that they know who took my little brother.

I can’t explain it, but when I’m here, I feel closer to Garrett.

My dreams are more vivid, and it… it’s like I can almost…

Change what happened?

Did you ask them about this?

Yeah, I tried.

I don’t think they like me very much.

But… they do like Abby.

Mike, you need to drop this.

I don’t really see how that’s any of your business.

I’m telling you, you need to let it go.

Who the hell are you?

Just someone who’s trying to help.

(over speakers): (music plays) Well, I’m just out of school (music plays)

(music plays) Like I’m real, real cool (music plays)

(music plays) Ooh, yeah, I’m a wild one (music plays)

Vanessa, wait.

(music plays) Gonna break it loose… (music plays)

Talk to me.

I’m trying.

You’re not listening.

Please. Finding the guy that did this is the only thing that matters to me.

MIKE (muffled): Abby?

Abby? Abby!

(coughing)

(Vanessa sighs)

(Abby whimpers)

What happened?

VANESSA: It’s okay, Abby.

You just had an accident.

You’re okay.

I’m so sorry.

(mechanical clicking)

I don’t know what to say.

Just go home, Mike.

Take care of your sister.

What are you so afraid of?

In the storage room…

I saw your eyes. You were terrified.

You can do whatever you want with your own life, but if you ever bring Abby back here again, I will shoot you.

(engine starts in distance)

ABBY: She looked so angry.

Why does everyone always look at you that way?

Hey, it’s Mike.

I need your help.

Abby.

Is that bacon?

Hey, why don’t you, uh, get dressed and then come to the kitchen, okay?

I want to talk to you about something.

Okay.

Wow, there’s my favorite little girl.

MIKE: Come have a seat, all right?

What did you do?

Abby, look, I think if you just sit down, we can explain it to you, okay?

No.

I promise you, this is not what you think it is.

I hate you.

I hate you, Mike!

(door slams)

Well, I-I think that went well.

(breathing heavily)

(music plays) (music plays)

She reminds me of you, you know.

Always with the temper.

Well, look, when she calms down, can you, um, tell her that I’m sorry and that I’ll-I’ll be back soon?

Well, Mike, there’s a larger conversation that needs to happen here.


So when you do get back, you and me are gonna have a little chat.

Okay.

(playing softly): (music plays) Celebrate good times, come on (music plays)

(papers rustling)

(music plays) Let’s celebrate (music plays)

Hey, buddy.

Well, don’t just stand there. Dig in.

(music plays) (music plays)

Sweetheart, what’s wrong?

This… this isn’t…

this isn’t how it happened.

This isn’t real.

BOY: But it could be.

What is this?

This isn’t what I asked for.

But it’s what you want.

No. I just, I just want to find the man that…

You’re lying.

You want to save Garrett.

That’s why you’re really here.

To change what happened.

To go back.

But I can’t.

He’s gone. They’re all gone.

Really?

You can have this dream every night.

You can be together with him again.

Like before.

How?

BOY: You said we could have anything we wanted.

We want Abby.

Abby?

They love her, Mike, and she loves them.

You’ve seen her with them.

You’ve seen how happy she is.

It’s time to let her go, sweetheart.

You were never the right person to take care of her.

(breathing shakily)

Okay. (sniffles)

(voice breaking): Yes.

You’re home.

(music plays) (music plays)

No.

No, this is wrong.

I don’t, I don’t want this. Listen…

Please, I don’t want this!

Careful.

I managed to stop the bleeding, but you’re probably gonna need stitches.

Where are we?

Police supply outpost.

I found you, and, uh, you were… you were badly hurt.

They tried to kill me, Vanessa.

But I’m guessing you already knew that.

Max.

Her brother.

You knew about them, too, right?

It’s complicated.

Yeah.

(scoffs) Yeah.

More complicated than possessed robots murdering innocent people?

They weren’t innocent.

Yeah, Abby is!

Mike… -You saw Abby playing with them.

And you knew what they were capable of, and you didn’t say anything!

Mike, please just…

Abby is in danger!

Tell me what happened.

In my dream… they asked me for Abby.

And I said yes.

It was a mistake, and I-I tried to fix it, but…

What do they want with my sister?

They want to make her like them.

(music plays) (music plays)

Come on, let’s go.

Where’d you go?

(lights buzzing softly)

VANESSA: In the ’80s, when those kids went missing… the police searched Freddy’s from top to bottom.

Every inch was accounted for.

But they never found them.

Hello?

VANESSA: The man who took them, he was a…

He was a very bad man.

A very cruel man.

Also a very clever man.

He knew that parents would cry, and the police would come looking.

And he knew there’s one place they’d never think to check because…

(lights clanking)

…why would they?

I mean, why would anyone?

It’s not just their ghosts that are inside of those machines.

It’s their bodies.

You have to understand, the… the kids, they don’t want to hurt anyone.

It’s-it’s him.

He influences them somehow.

He took everything from them, but they don’t remember.

Who, Vanessa?

I tried to warn you.

I really did try in my own way.

But it’s too late now.

He knows that you’re looking for him.

He’ll be coming.

You need to tell me who he is.

VANESSA: His name is William Afton.

He’s my father.

(music plays) (music plays)

(Garrett imitating airplane)

You knew?

(crying): Mike…

This whole time.

My brother, you knew.

Not about Garrett, no.

A-At least… not when we met.

I’m so, so sorry.

Tell me how to stop them.

Tell me how to save my sister!

It won’t do permanent damage, but it’ll mess with the animatronic circuitry.

Hopefully buy you some time.

Come with me.

No.

Vanessa, you owe it to me, and you owe it to them.

No, I can’t.

If he’s there, I…

I won’t be any use to you, believe me.

I don’t know why she was trying to hurt me.

I know. I know.

Hey, Abby, listen to me.

I’ve been an idiot about so many things.

I’ve been stuck trying to fix the past, but you are the most important thing in the world to me, and I promise you I’m gonna do better.

They’re all alone.

Right.

No one takes care of them anymore.

Can we visit them sometime?

They were big, so not a lot of people went around hassling them.

Actually, no people went around hassling them because there weren't any people yet.

A-ha. No, no, no. Don't touch it.

No, it's not a big problem. Just leave it to the professionals.

- I was somewhere else. Another dimension, you mean?

Sure.

Another dimension... OK, we'll be right there.

Luigi, we got a broken dishwasher at the Riverfront Cafe.

You know what that means? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

We got work!

Mario, Mario, right now on Miraculous World, this guy just found out he was in another dimension.

The only thing miraculous I know is that we're still eating.

While we're going broke.

We ain't goin' broke, Mario. We're already there.

Yeah?

Ow! Are you spending money on this stuff?

Look at this!

Yeah, but it's got the article about the missing Brooklyn girls.

Yeah? It's also got one of the scientists who turns brains into cheese.

Yeah. You don't know. It could happen.

(LAUGHS) How could that possibly happen?

Anything's possible, Mario. You just gotta believe.

I do believe. I believe the rent is three months overdue. That's what I believe.

Hey, turn left here.

Left! I said left!

What are you doing? I don't know, Mario.

Just trust me. I got a good feeling about this alleyway. I don't know.

What?

My instincts tell me this'll be faster. Breathe in, big brother. We'll get there.

Luigi!

You know, I read that sea turtles navigate thousands of miles on instinct.

Not in New York traffic, they don't.

What are you complaining about? We're here, aren't we?

You're gettin' worse. I'm gettin' worse?

How did we get into sea turtles?

Faster. What did I tell you, huh?

It's a miracle we made it alive.

I thought you didn't believe in miracles, Mr Tough Guy, huh?

It's him again.

I'm the boss here.

I'm Anthony Scapelli.

I'm the boss elsewhere. My boys need to get back to work here.

How long you gonna be digging up these bones?

As long as our court order lasts, Mr Scapelli.

The university has explained to you how important this site is.

But we'd be done here a lot sooner if the g*ons would stop harassing us.

You look like a smart girl.

I bet you'll be done by tonight.

I'd be careful.

James, I'm gonna find a phone and call the university.

All right.

Keep everyone digging till I get back.

No.

Hi, it's Daisy. Listen, we're gonna need more security down here.

I don't care about the money. Scapelli's down here making threats and I...

She's beautiful, huh?

Who?

Her.

She's nice. Go talk to her. Go on. No, I can't.

I don't know what to say. What's the matter with you?

Fine.

(SIGHS) Bye.

Here she comes.

Excuse me. Thank you.

For letting me use the phone. Sure.

And for the quarter.

Are you OK?

I've got a few problems, but...

You know, we got a van.

It's nice.

No, no. I'm asking you if you want a ride.

Oh but...

It's broken though.

Well...

Your name's Daisy, isn't it?

I overheard your name was Daisy.

I haven't heard that name around here. It's really nice too.

No, I have heard it, cos it's like the flower and everything.



Not that I hang around flower shops or nothing like that.

What my brother is trying to say is he doesn't know what to say.



Doesn't even know how to begin but he has offered you a ride.

And if it would help you out, please step into the van.

That might not be a bad idea.

OK.

Thanks.

I thought it was broken. I fixed it.

Oh, here. This is as far as we can go. I'll have to walk the rest of the way.

Wait, wait, wait.

Ma'am? Why, thank you, sir!

Thank you for the ride.

It's a pleasure to meet me.

I mean it's a pleasure to meet you.

Dinner.

Do you eat?

Yeah.

Dinner?

Sure.

Tonight. Tonight?

Oh! OK.

Is six o'clock all right?

Be here.

Great.

Bye.

Bye.

What would you do without your big brother, huh?

I'd like to give it a sh*t and find out.

Come on! I was just about to ask her that.

You weren't about to ask her nothing. You was gonna let her go.

Now she's gonna think I'm a complete idiot.

Come on. You'll see her tonight. You impress her with your manners.

Yeah, but why did you tell her I suck my thumb?

So let me get this perfectly clear here.

What we're discussing is bones.

Not exactly.

OK, so Scapelli blasted through the bones in the rock and found what?

Iridium. Oh.

That's unbelievable!

It means that a meteorite h*t here a long time ago.

And we think it could be what destroyed all the dinosaurs.

Wow! There were dinosaurs in Brooklyn?

Relax, Luigi. There used to be Dodgers here too!

Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you come down to the tanning salon and I can hook you up with some free tans?

Bring a nice bathing suit though, strapless so you don't get a tan line.

You probably wanna take off that rock. Actually...

I never take it off.

I know it sounds weird, but it's the only thing I have from when I was found.

Found?

I was abandoned.

I grew up at St Teresa's on Fulton Street.

You mean you don't know who your mother and father are neither?

No. What do you mean "neither"?

Cos Mario here brought me up.

He's been my mother my whole life. Hey!

My father. He's been my father, my uncle, my brother - everybody.

What are you two kids gonna do tonight?

We can take the van back ourselves.

Um... If you're not doing anything later tonight...

I would like to walk you home.

OK.

(SNORING)

Spike! Spike!

Where you going? To get the girl.

That's not the girl.

She's wearing a disguise. I can spot her a mile away.

Of course she's wearing a disguise. She thinks she can fool us.

I'm gonna go get her.

I'm gonna go get her. Wait a minute.

We'll follow her and we'll both go get her.

Good idea. I bag her, you grab her. No, I grab her, you bag her.

That's what I said. Exactly.

This is the one.

That's what you said about the last four girls.

I did? You did.

I just wanna say one thing first.

I wanna apologise right now in case, when I start to get talking, I start to say things that sound really weird.

Weird?

Look, weird is working in a bone pit all day and then spending your nights reading about things that have been dead for 65 million years.

That is weird. I find it fascinating.

And I mean, you know what? If you just wanna end this right now...

I would understand.

I was gonna ask you the same thing.

If you wanna end this right now and you feel bad about that, but you wanna talk to somebody about it, you can call me.

You really think what I do is interesting?

I think it's incredible.

Well, you know...

If you want...

I could show you.

I'd love you to show me.

Show me.

See you tomorrow. OK. Good night.

Drive carefully.

(SCREAMS) Mario!

You don't stand a chance. (LAUGHING)

I won!

That's what you think.

That was sneaky!

We don't even have any security here.

That's what I was calling about on the phone today.

I can't get the university to give me any extra money.

Is that why you were talking about Scapelli?

Yeah. Scapelli was down here with his crew blasting at the site and that's when they found the fossils.

Do you know where you're going?

It's just ahead.

What is this? ls this your office or something? Doesn't it give you the creeps?

Well, it's more like a home. I feel, I don't know, comfortable down here.

Comfortable? OK.

Well, this is it. Wow!

Have a look.

Awesome!

Oh, check this out.

These are all strange new species.

Look at this one - the way the bones fit here.

And the opposable thumb - it's almost as if he was a monster trying to be a human being.

It's beautiful.

You're beautiful.

Oh my... Hey! Hey, you guys!

They're Scapelli's. Oh no!

What did they do?

What is that down there?

Destroying everything under the sump pumps. Thank God you're here.

What do you mean?

You're a plumber, right? Oh, yeah.

I know exactly what to do.

Mario, Scapelli's flooding the site. We need your help.

Scapelli? Yeah.

Strap your bone on, kid. We're goin' in.

Scapelli's been trying to force us out ever since we got here. It's sabotage.

Down here.

Hurry!

This way. Allow me, I'm a professional.

Looks like a bottom one, right? Yeah.

Bottom 116 open-end.

Bottom 116 open-ended.

Wrong again. How many times have we got this wrong?

You've gotten it wrong five times.

Home for five, home for five. What percent is that?

I don't know. Let me think.

I don't know, but it's not good.

If we get it wrong one more time, he's gonna k*ll us.

He's not gonna k*ll us. He's not that nice.

(BANGING)

UP ahead!

It's her.

I sense her. (SNIFFING)

I definitely know it's her.

Basin wrench.

Basin wrench. Great.

Here.

Hand.

Hand.

Now, does this guys know his stuff or does this guy know his stuff?!

I'm tellin' you.

OK, you ready? Say when.

Let's go...now!

Scapelli's just an amateur.

(SCREAMS)

Daisy? Daisy, where are you? (DAISY SCREAMING)

Daisy! Answer me! Daisy, where are you?

Let's go this way. No, no!

Let's go this way. No, it's this way.

That's the echo. How do you know?

I've been listening to pipes all my life. Come on.

OK. Daisy!

Luigi, this is a mistake. It's a dead end. Come on, let's turn back.

OK, you go back. Luigi, please.

Give me the light. Come on, give me the light.

(DAISY'S SCREAMS ECHO) Daisy!

Luigi, you see how deep that is? Get back.

Agh!

The light! Lean back!

Let it go! Agh, God!

Hold on to me.

Daisy?

Daisy!

Watch it.

(DAISY'S VOICE ECHOES) Luigi!

sh*t!

Help me!

Daisy! ls that you?

Luigi!

No!

' Luigi! Help! Daisy!

Get off of me!

(WHOOSH)

Oh!

Did you see that? Yeah. You?

Yeah. Oh!

That's solid rock.

I got a feeling.

Luigi, forget it.

Gotta go with it.

Forget it. It's rock.

Look down there. Luigi!

Luigi!

I don't believe this.

Ugh!

Er...

Ash! Agh!

(SCREAMING)

Mario!

I disintegrated. Am I still here?

What is this place?

There she is. Come on! Hurry up. Run.

Where are you taking me?

Back to where you belong.

You're hurting me! I'm gonna k*ll 'em.

No, you're not gonna k*ll 'em. Not if I get there first.

I'm gonna break every bone in their body.

Then I'm gonna k*ll 'em. I'm really gonna k*ll 'em.

I- Help me! Daisy! I'm coming!

Get off of me! Excuse me.

You better not hurt her.

Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

Shuttle to Koopa Union is cancelled. Passengers transferring to the Square...

Get outta my way!

MARIO: Where the hell are we?

This is crazy. We're under the river, but this can't be Manhattan.

Where is this place?

LUIGI: I don't know. I ain't been to Manhattan in a couple of weeks.

Must've been a bad couple of weeks.

DAISY: No!

There she is! Daisy!

Luigi?

Daisy!

Luigi!

Mario! We're coming.

You better not hurt her. Come on, somebody, do something.

Somebody stop her!

Daisy! Are you a cop, or what?

Move on. Come on, let's go.

Agh!

Are you OK?

I'm OK, yeah. You're the one without the padding.

Yeah, well, you're the old one.

Oh, my God! Look at that. Watch out!

Ugh! Let's go.

Excuse me.

It's all sticky. Yuck!

Smell this! Smells really good!

Get away from my baby! Get away from my baby!

What is this place? I don't know.

This is crazy.

Where are we?

I don't know. Maybe we got knocked unconscious for 100 years and woke up in Manhattan of the future.

Maybe the Bronx of today.

No wonder they tell you never to come up here.

Mario, I got a feeling.

I got a feeling we're not in Brooklyn no more.

Where you goin'? Hey!

(GROWLS)

Look at this place. Pathetic! It gets worse every day.

It's disgusting.

The humans on the other side have a world full of resources.

Ready for the taking. I know.

Imagine it. An endless supply of food, clean air, water.

And what are we stuck with?

This... pit hole of germs everywhere, fungus.

65 million years we've been exiled here after the meteorite struck.

While mammals roam free in the other dimension.

Well, not for long.

When you get your rock.

When I get the princess.

Princess?

I need the rock, and the Princess Daisy and I'll finally be able to merge our world with theirs and get rid of the mammals.

It's everything you've hoped for, everything you've worked for.

Excuse me, cousin. Hello, morons.

Hello! Hello!

I captured the princess.

She's being defungussed.

But I took her through the gateway. I recognised her.

He couldn't tell one mammal from another.

Good. Now, where's the rock?

Rock, sir? Rock?

The meteorite piece that she wears around her neck and I told you not to forget it.

That rock! I told you not to forget it.

And I told you to remind him.

Without that piece the meteorite lays dormant.

I'll not be able to merge the dimensions.

Where is it?

The plumbers took it.

Plumbers?

Plumber alert.

Plumber alert.

That's right. The Koopa man is looking for a couple of plumbers.

And there's a big coin reward. 2,000 gold Koopa coins.

Guess he must have a serious plumbing problem.

20 Koopons, spiny burger here.

Fried tweeter, only 20 Koopons. You like little wigglers? 15.

Hey, listen, if we're gonna eat in this place we're gonna have to be very hungry.

Excuse me, lady, can you tell me where I am?

Yeah, you're in my way, egg suckers! Who are these people?

Are you boys new here in town? Lady, we're looking for somebody.

We're from Brooklyn. Yeah.

You know, it's very dangerous in this neighbourhood.

You shouldn't wander around without a w*apon.

Yeah.

You got one?

No.

All right.

Get 'em up, suckers! Koopa coins.

I need Koopa coins, you lame-os.

Well, this outta do it. Don't, don't touch that!

Just fine. That's not even ours.

Hey!

Let me go!

Where're you...? Put me down!

(SCREAMS)

Rats!

You wanna give us the rock back, lady?

Come and get it, big boy.

Hey! Hey, guys-

Cheer up! Things could get worse.

♪ Ain't got no water anywhere

♪ Food's scarce, so's the air

♪ Got no resources, in a great big stupor

♪ All because of the evil King Koopa ♪ Agh! You know the law, Toad.

Hey, wait a minute. You can't arrest a guy for just singing a song.

For anti-Koopa songs we can.

Aha! Plumbers!

No, he is. I'm just apprenticing.

Get in the car. But I didn't do anything.

Are you telling us you can arrest a guy for being a plumber?

Get outta here! Get in there, plumber!

Hey, what is this? What did we do?

I'm getting arrested for being a plumber.

Write his number down.

Stop pushing me! ls that Daisy?

Daisy! Daniella?

Daisy, you too!

Daniella! Daisy!

Are you OK? What's going on?

I don't really know.

There's this guy, his name is Koopa, and he's looking for this princess.

I guess none of us here fit the bill.

You boys ain't from around here, are ya?

Brooklyn.

Whoa!

(SCREAMING)

(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)

Hey! What are you doing?

MARIO: Don't we get a phone call?

Name? Mario.

Last name.

Mario.

OK, what's your name? Luigi.

Luigi Luigi?

No. Luigi Mario.

OK, look, how many Marios are there between the two of you?

There's three. There's Mario Mario and Luigi Mario.

Mike. Mike!

Help these Marios around the side.

Stop pushing me around.

Prepare to be defungussed. I'm not going in there.

Agh!

Hold still.

It's cold! Agh!

What is this?

Let's go. Move it! Come on!

That way. Let's go.

What was that?

The fungus unit. The fungus is choking the city.

Move! Move!

OK, through the gate, through the gate.

Move it! Go! Go!

Come on! Come on!

Hey, Mario, look! I grew an inch.

What's that?

What's that red...? Oh my God! Oh no!

Oh no!

Agh! Agh!

Are we dead?

♪ How, how, how

(PLAYS HARMONICA)

♪ Sitting here in cramped detention

♪ We're brothers from another dimension

♪ Thinking about my... ♪ What's another word that rhymes with dimension?

Yeah, tension, and I'm full of it, so shut up.

Wait a minute. What did you mean "another dimension"?

Did you mean our worlds have crossed over or something like that?



Sure, kid. You know, according to history, a long time ago, big meteorite came, blasted our universes into parallel dimensions.

You know what else I think? All that fungus out there, that's our old king.

It's true. He's been de-evolved.

That's right. He's been de-evolved into fungus and now he's wreaking his revenge on the city.

Mario Brothers. Yeah, that's us.

You better get a lawyer and get us out of this chicken coop.

Yeah, me too!

You got one.

I got 'em. Let's go. Come on.

Just let me do it. Shut up!

Boys! Boys! Sit down.

How's prison?

You look like hell.

I'm...

Larry Lazard of Lazard, Lazard, Conda, Dactyl and Cohen.

Who sent you?

Are you from the city?

No, I'm from that little part of all of us that can't stand to see someone else in need or in pain.

I bet. Who's this Koopa clown?

We gotta talk to that goofball now.

I don't think you wanna do that.

Why? Why not?

That Koopa clown... Yeah?

...is one evil, egg-sucking son of a snake.

Now... where is that meteorite piece?

The what?

(RASPING)

(GROWLS)

You know what I'm talking about!

Agh! No-one touches President Koopa.

You're Koopa? You just said you were one evil...

One evil egg-sucking son of a snake.

Did I lie?

Take these two plumbers to the devo chamber.

I'm all right. Come on.

(BUZZING)

What a lousy chamber.

Ever since Koopa took over.

And you, Koopa!

You're a lousy leader.

One thing I cannot stand is naysay.

Simon, de-evolve him now.

(ROBOT VOICE) De-evolve!

Cretaceous.

Our old king - you tried to get rid of him, but the king is everywhere.

You can't get rid of him. See you later, alligator.

Ever!

(SCREAMING)

You may think of evolution as an upward process.

Things evolve from primeval slime, up to single-cell organisms, up to intelligent life.

De-evolution, of course, works the opposite way.

Back to simpler forms, for instance, even our musical friend Toad can become... a loyal child of the royal family.

Goombas.

Why d'you do that to him? No, no.

Not now.

What single-cell organism did you evolve from?

Tyrannosaurus Rex, the lizard king, thank you very much.

Goomba! Whereas my evolution was wonderful and sweet, your de-evolution will be a living nightmare if you don't tell me where that meteorite piece is.

That's Toad? Yes.

Loyal, lethal...

...stupid.

(LAUGHS) Goomba!

Walk tall! Be proud!

Go, Goomba!

Join the goombas!

Agh!

Guards! Guards! Arrest these plumbers.

De-evolve Jurassic.

You're going back where you belong, lizard.

Help me! Help me!

Keep going. Got it.

Yeah! Let's get outta here.

I'll k*ll that plumber!

(ALARM BLARING)

We're back at the police station.

Hey, Mario, look at this. These little mushroom things on the fungus.

Great. A building with athlete's foot!

Hey, look at that. What is that?

Goombas. Come on, let's go!

Look, he was trying to give us that thing.

Swing! Keep swingin'.

I'm swingin', I'm swingin'!

Just keep hanging. Close your eyes.

Hey! Look at these dudes.

Yee-ha! Whoo!

Hang on.

Hey, man, this is fun!

What was that? Get ready.

You ready? I'm ready, I'm ready.

Whoo!

Yeah, yeah!

(SCREAMING)

Let go! Now!

Right. Which door?

My instinct tells me this one.

Let's go in this one.

Come on. I'm coming.

Here we are.

They got us. What are we gonna do?

Number one - we steal this car.

Number two - I'm driving.

All right, whatever. Come on!

Wait for me. Don't take off.

OK. Let's see what I got over here.

Where's the starter on this thing?

I got a feeling about this, Marioroni.

I don't believe you can do that.

Comes from sitting on my butt all day playing video games, that's why.

Got it. Let's get outta here.

Let's h*t the bricks.

Hey!

(SIRENS WAILING)

Security alert. Stand by for special bulletin.

Mario, look!

You look terrible.

You don't look so good yourself.

Alien species escaping from police detention...

Aliens? We gotta deal with aliens too?

Luigi, we're the aliens!

We are? Whoa! Cool!

Hey, Mario, you're going the wrong way.

How would you know? Trust me.

You're driving like a maniac. Would you watch it?

You wanna drive?

I'm not riding with you any more. OK, you drive.

No! What are you doin'?

How are you steering this? I'm not.

I hope the guy downstairs knows where we're going.

Hey-hey! This is driving!

Cool, man!

(SIREN WAILS)

Brace yourself!

(SHOUTING)

BOTH: Glug-glug-glug-glug!

Which way?

Take the Parkway. Right.

Perfect, perfect!

You said the Parkway. I know.

But I wanted the tunnel so I said Parkway cos I knew you'd go the opposite way I suggested.

Hey, watch it! What are you doin'?

Warning - leaving power grid. Powering down.

I can't stop this thing.

I can't see where I'm going. Look out, Mario!

Use the brakes. There are no brakes.

Do something! This fungus is going to k*ll us!

We're gonna h*t the end of the tunnel!

(SCREAMING)

(BOING)

Hey, was that superior driving skills or what?

Let's get outta here before this fungus stuff eats us alive.

The fungus just saved us.

What are you talking about? It was my driving that saved us.

It wasn't your driving. The tunnel just sneezed us out and this giant bogey caught us. That's what saved us.

Ah! Come on! Let's get outta here.

Excuse, sir! Excuse me, sir.

Sorry?

Sir?

I'm sorry, we didn't meant to disturb you but the plumbers are in the tunnel. They're on their way to the desert.

What are you doing here instead of being in the desert heading them off?




That's exactly what I told him, sir. Exactly what I told him.

Between you and me, Spike hasn't got a thought in his brain.

Ah! Ah! He's a liar, sir.

Between us, Iggy doesn't have a brain in his head.

I agree.

They're your relatives.

Wait outside.

We'll wait outside.

Lena, bring me the princess and have her cleaned up.

Do you know what I love about mud?

It's clean and it's dirty at the same time.

The princess.

Are you here to help us?

Hardly.

Now let me guess which one of you is Daisy.

Princess Daisy.

Princess? What?

Princess Daisy? This is gettin' weird.

Oh. You have your mother's eyes.

Come with me.

Goodbye, Spike. I'm gonna miss ya.

Have a nice trip. See you next Fall.

Evolve.

Advanced.

Good choice, cousin. I always thought he'd make a great goomba.

Bye. Spike.

(CRIES)

Ah! It's our benevolent dictator.

As it were.

Ignatius, do you know what the square root of 26,481 is?

What are you talking about?

191.

What are you doing? Not me!

Not me, cousin, not me!

Spike! Help me, Spike!

Perhaps if I could just make you idiots smarter, you won't screw up this time.

Please! Not me, cous, no!

(SCREAMS)

Oh my!

How peculiar!

Quite an agreeable transmogrification.

More like a transfiguration.

Ah! A super metamorphosis. Mm.

Enough! Both of you, go to the desert.

Excuse me, excuse me, that hardly seems logical.

Perhaps we should stay and formulate our own strategy.

Téte a téte, inner circle, that sort of thing.

Here's what's logical to me.

If you do not return with the plumbers and the rock...

...l shall personally k*ll you.

We're going. After you, Ignatius.

It was your mother's.

What do you know about my mother?

She was quite an inspiration.

To some.

When Koopa took over, she stole the rock and smuggled you to the other side.

Then she d*ed.

What about my father? ls he alive?

It depends on what you mean by living.

What are you talking about?

Listen to me.

I don't care whose daughter you are.

Koopa thinks you're the only one who can merge the dimensions.

I have waited too long to let all this slip away.

You said the tunnel.

I did not. I said Parkway.

But you meant the tunnel.

Go on, pick a direction. Any direction you like.

(IMITATES MARIO)

That looks good, I'll go there. That's it - let's die there.

Are the goombas training with the hand-held de-evolution g*n?

As we speak, sir.

Excellent.

After the merge, it will be nice to see the humans de-evolve, won't it?

What is it that they come from? I keep forgetting.

It's mice or something. Apes, sir, monkeys.

Disgusting mammals! Pah!

Your princess is here.

My, my. Looks like you got up on the wrong side of the nest this morning.

(SQUAWKS)

(SQUAWKS)

(SQUAWKS)

(SQUAWKS)

You're a... Go ahead and say it.

Dinosaur.

(SQUAWKS)

Yoshi is a pet of the royal family. You may pet him.

Just don't move your hands around like a small wounded animal.

You must be the great Koopa.

That I am.

Ruler of all that you see.

A few miserable streets and endless desert.

You've done a lovely job.

Well...

...thank you.

Where's my father?

Ah!

Mm.

He's around.

You're so fresh.

And so clean.

Don't fight it.

You know you've always been uncomfortable in the human world.

You've at least suspected that you were...

...different.

I have suspected a lot of things but not that I...

That you descended from the dinosaurs.

And you know what they say about little girls, don't you?

No. -Mm?

They say... they never forget the first time they're kissed by a lizard.

Agh!

Take her away.

I'll need to... use her later.

Throwback!

Plumbers!

Affirmative!

Come, come, quickly!

Quickly, after them, cousin! I'm with you, cousin!

Go forward!

That way, cous.

Go right, go right! Agh!

(CRASH)

Ah! Ah! In the name of King Koopa...

BOTH: We arrest you.

Surrender immediately.

(DINOSAURS SQUEAKING)

If you two don't start talking, we're gonna leave you to these guys for lunch.

Now, where's Daisy?

No, no, no. Where's the rock, scallywag?

Where's Daisy, butt-breath?

Where's the rock, over-weaning rogue?

Not until you give us Daisy, biscuit-head.

Where's the rock? Shut up!

Now...what's with this rock?

The rock is a piece of a special meteorite which was chipped off upon impact 65 million years ago.

Yes, you see once this rock is reinserted into the meteorite, our two dimensions will reunite and we will become one.



Then our cousin Koopa shall become ruler of both our worlds.

I don't get it.

Why didn't he just come through before like you clowns?

You fool! It's been sealed off for years until someone on your side blasted it open again.

Scapelli.

What if we get you the rock? Will you get us Daisy?

Yeah, yeah.

Yes, I think that proposal would mutually benefit both our parties.

Yes, OK, now hand over the rock.

Someone took it.

By the bar. That lady with the red spikes who mugged us...

Was she corpulent? Very corpulent? No, she was just really round.

Aha! Big Bertha, the bouncer at the Boom Boom Bar.

(SQUEAKING)

(SQUEALING)

Hey! Don't do that. You'll hurt yourself.

Oh!

(LAUGHING)

I guess we're both prisoners here, huh?

Look, sniff-its. We'll hijack a sludge gulper and drive into the city.

Then what?

First we get the rock then we'll take you to Daisy in the tower.

Get your wrench.

Oh, man! I lost all my tools.

Ah! Come on, let's go.

Come on, what are you waiting for?

It's clear. All clear.

We did it.

Yeah! I'm brilliant!

For mammals, you guys are quite acceptable.

(MUSIC PLAYS)

Isn't this a little bit feminine?

Yes, I know. It was my ex-wife's.

But you wear this stuff?

Yes, on occasion we have a date.

Thanks.

(LAUGHING)

Look, look! Look, another one!

Wait, Mario, I think it wants me to take it.

Stop fiddling with the fungus, and let's get outta here.

There they are. Get 'em!

Cops! Goombas!

Daisy! The rock!

The tower!

A Sludge gulper. Jump! OK!

What a way to go to Koopa's tower.

You wanna wait for a bus?

How are we gonna get in there?

I got two words for you, im-possible.

Nothing's impossible, Mario.

Improbable, unlikely, but never impossible.

I hope you're right.

My my!

You have let yourself go.

See? I'm not such a bad guy.

You always wanted to be everywhere. Well, now you are.

I wanna tell you something.

You can go ahead and choke this little mushroom kingdom all you want.

Cos I'm outta here.

I'm out into the bigger world.

I got a couple of plumbers bringing me the rest of the meteorite.

Soon to be dead plumbers, and by the way, you really outta try to pull yourself back together again.

Slime bucket!

Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!

Eugh!

MARIO: Oh my God!

LUIGI: Daisy's in there somewhere, I know it.

MARIO: Where do we start?

Python Pizza here. May I help you?

King Koopa here. Oh, yes, sir.

I'd like the Koopa Special.

Pterodactyl tail on that? Yes.

Dino, lizard, hold the mammal, no worms, and...spicy.

MARIO: Look at this. It's a plumber's nightmare.

These pipes haven't been serviced for years.

Must've been a non-union job.

Luigi, lock all four of these valves.

What? It's the heating system.

Ow!

Treat your tools like a friend. Keep 'em by you.

Never let 'em down, and they're always at your side.

Hey, Mario, how come in every situation that can possibly come up, you always got a saying about tools, huh?

I got 'em from Poppa. He got 'em from Grandpoppa.

We'll freeze 'em. Keep 'em busy while we make our way up.

How can we do that? We can't just take an elevator.

We gotta do something. We tripped the alarm. What do you think I am? Stupid?

Yes. How we gonna get up? Huh?

Like Marios.

(ALARM RINGING)

Haha!

Ingeniously.

Come on.

Glug-glug-glug- glug!

Look out!

Elevator ingenious, Mario! Ingenious!

I think you ought to know that Iggy and Spike have been preaching your overthrow at the Boom Boom Bar.

Really? I am very disappointed in you, cousins.

Fascist! Oppressor of the Proletariat!

Guy in charge!

Egg sucker!

k*ll them!

Koopa, we need to talk. I want you.

This is hardly the time and place for that, Lena.

I didn't mean that. What I mean is I think we can do this together. I can help you.

I have just found out that I have saboteurs in the tower.

I still do not have the meteorite piece.

I am about to lose everything.

We can talk about this later, if later even occurs.

What you care about is her.

What I care about...is the future of our species.

Very well then.

If not with you... then on my own.

(WHISPERS) Now what are we gonna do? I don't know.

Listen...

(SINGING)

What? Trust me.

What are you...?

(FRANKIE YANKOVIC: Somewhere My Love)

One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

(DOOR OPENS)

For me?

I'm a vegetarian.

I don't eat anything with a face.

I am kinda hungry though.

Any chance of a plate of steamed vegetables?

Am I interrupting?

Out!

Lena, look, I know you don't want me here.

So maybe...

I like this room. Don't you?

It used to be my office, you know, until I got promoted.

Koopa needed me close by, you see.

Lena, will you help me get out of here?

Well, I think yes.

I'd love to get you out of here.

Why are you doing this?

Because everyone deserves what they've earned.

And I've earned this.

(SCREAMS)

(MUSIC STILL PLAYS)

(SHOUTS)

(SHOUTS)

(MEN SHOUTING)

YOU?

Yes, it's us. Your most royal highness, please... ls it possible you could assist us in escaping?

Help! Help us please!

Help! (SCREAMS)

Spikosaurus, follow me!

Where are you going? I have to help him.

Stand still.

You stay. I'll go.

OK, I'll stay, you go.

You stay and I'll go. OK, I'll go.

Allow me.

I hope he's all right.

Princess Daisy, we've always been your loyalist supporters.

We've been with your father since his demise.

My father? What do you know about my father?

Come with us.

(COUGHING)

You tell her. No, I think you should tell her.

All right. We'll both tell her.

Daisy, I think this may come as something of a shock.

Daisy, may I present to you...

...your father.

The fungus.

Koopa's first victim of de-evolution.

This is my father?

Yes.

Perhaps at this moment of delicacy...

A delicate moment...

A retreat is in order. An ordered retreat.

Those that fight and run away... Live to fight another day.

How did you know they'd do that?

Cos everybody loves to dance, that's why.

A dancing lizard like dancing crocodiles. Oh!

Oh wow! Oh man!

Oh, I hate heights.

How are we gonna get across?

I can make it. I got a good feeling. You're not gonna jump.

Come on. Somebody's gotta do it. I don't got no choice, right?

Luigi, this is not Miraculous World. I gotta go for it.

Agh! " Luigi!

I'm flying, Mario, I'm flying!

Come on. I told you. All you had to do is trust. Come on.

Let's do it. Come on. Just have faith. Jump.

You're flying. Come on, Mario. Just trust. Jump.

Come on. OK, OK.

OK. Just... OK. Come on.

No, wait, Mario. Don't jump. It's not...

I'm not flying. It's just a...hook.

Agh! Mario!

Oh, Luigi! Oops!

Sorry!

Mario, I got you.

Luigi, I'm alive.

Good catch, huh, Mario? I should try out for the Yankees.

I'd high five you, but then you'd be an only child.

Let's go get Daisy.

Let's swing over there, yeah?

Go with me. OK.

My father?

What have they done to you?

Can you even hear me?

Yoshi!

Look what she did to you.

Mario? Daisy!

Luigi?

Mario!

It's Daisy. Daisy, we're comin'!

Let's get you off.

Luigi, Mario, can you hear me?

Daisy, where are you?

I'm in Devo 4.

Daisy.

Oh, man, it's cold.

It's working. It's freezing up. Great!

Hey, Mario, did you see that?

What? It's trying to communicate.

Luigi, it's a mushroom. Come on.

(SHOUTS)

DAISY: Luigi, here!

Come back. In here. This way. There she is.

Good news, sir. The troops are in place ready to de-evolve the mammals.

Place ready to what? Now?

Who ordered their deployment?

You did, sir. Lena relayed the command. We carried it out immediately.

Lena?

She has the rock.

Arrest her!

Daisy! " Luigi!

Let's get out of here. This place is crawling with giant lizards.

Wait, listen. I know this is going to sound a little strange but...

I want you to meet...

...my father.

Come on. Dad.

Oh man. Well, at least he was my father.

He used to be the leader here, until Koopa turned him into all this...fungus.

Oh, man! Well...

Well, it's an honour to meet you, sir, and a pleasure and I just wanna thank you for all your help.

Come on, Luigi, you'll be talking to the mildew in the shower next.

Mario, don't you see? It's been trying to help us all along, giving us the little things, when we were hanging there.

Come on. He wants to clobber Koopa too.

How's Daniella?

Is she all right? Daniella!

I promised to take her to Wrestle Mania.

You mean you don't know?

What?

She's in the goomba barracks on the 51st floor.

Come on, we need to help! Hi-di-ho, mammals.

Goombas!

If you touch her I'll k*ll you.

I'll meet you in the playground after school.

You m*rder!

Now, your father's still...hanging around, isn't he?

Prepare for the invasion, and ready the troops.

We're going down.

Station closing. m*llitary personnel only.

Station closing. m*llitary personnel only.

Hey, you. Open UP-

Restricted area. No unauthorised personnel.

Restricted area. No unauthorised personnel.

Agh!

Greetings from Koopa.

Agh!

Ah, the rock.

Can't we get some blankets.

Yeah, we're freezing.

Look, the point is we're freezing here.

They are not going to believe this at work.

This is a violation of our civil liberties.

Can't you get somebody to fix the heating?

How can they let us suffer like this? What are they? Cold-blooded?

Yes, moron. They're reptiles. Well, just because they're reptiles...

(MOUTHS WORDS)

(MOUTHS WORDS)

Angelica, come here.

Don't say anything, but my boyfriend Mario's right up there.

What? Shh!

(SHOUTS) Hey! Mario!

What are you doing here?

Yam Oh, Mario, I knew you'd come for me!

You betcha! Yes! He did it!

Honey, listen. Get that mattress, the goomba mattress. Take it over there.

Come on, girls. Get the goomba mattress. Pick it up, get that side.

Move it, move it.

Come on. Bring it over here.

Very good!

Hey! You must be the missing girls from Brooklyn.

Except Angelica - she's from Queens, but she's all right.

Hey, I'm freezing my butt off here. There's cold air from that air vent.

Yeah, we froze the pipes. We're going for a little ride.

Hail Koopa.

Sir?

I believe you are looking for this.

Excellent. Release Lena.

Princess, ready to help me destroy humankind?

Muster the goombas.

Hand out the de-evolution g*n. Prepare for destiny!

Where's my pizza?

(SCREAMING)

(SCREAMS ECHOING)

Goombas!

Down!

Duck now!

(ROARING)

Got ya! Yeah!

Devo g*n ready?

Yeah! Woo-hoo!

Agh!

BOTH: Are you all right?

Are they all right? Right!

Marioroni! Daniella!

Too late, humans.

Sir, your pizza's here.

Not now.

Looks like I win.

Soon you and everyone in your world will all be de-evolved into...

Sir? Sir?

- What is it now? The goombas are dancing again.

Deal with it.

...will be de-evolved into monkeys.

(LAUGHING)

Agh! (CROWD GASPS)

Give me that.

Ah! Yes!

Die, plumbers!

Take my tools and get out of those handcuffs.

Mario! What?

Take my belt.

Trust the fungus.

Trust the fungus.

Look out!

All right! Ya-hay!

Agh!

Yes! Agh!

(SCREAMS)

You wanna rock? I'll give you a rock.

Where's the rock?

Hey!

You looking for this?

Give it to me.

(LAUGHS)

Give me that rock, you monkey. It's mine!

Give it to me!

(LAUGHING)

I'll show him! We've gotta stop her!

Come on, girls, let's go. ALL: Who are you?

Luigi Mario. You got a problem with that?

I don't got a problem. Let's go.

Come on!

My time has come! The universe is mine!

You mammal, you give me that rock!

(HOOTING)

Agh!

My time will come!

The rock will merge our two dimensions. Lena, don't!

You're too late.

You see, I do have the power to merge the worlds, princess.

It's not too late. We've gotta stop her.

All right. Come on, girls. Come on, let's go.

Wait! Where are we going?

Back to where you came. Come this way.

Come and get it, lizard breath.

It's a bob-omb! He's got a bob-omb!

Bob-omb?

(CROWD SHOUTING)

Messed up again, mammal.

All right. Come on.

Come and get it.

Come on.

Come on, rufflehead, let's see what you're made of.

Don't look down!

You've gotta get through and tell everybody.

Go to Brooklyn. Tell them about the invasion and the goombas.

Good luck, Luigi!

It's incredible!

(SCREAMS)

Yikes!

Man, she sure makes an impression.

That's what Koopa meant.

Only I can withstand the force.

Come on.

It's jammed in. I can't get it.

Luigi, we've gotta stop it, we've gotta get it out.

Grab onto me.

Come and get it.

Oh!

It's melting.

We're merging.

You don't have the rock! You filthy mammal!

We're merging!

I'm gonna drill it out.

Give me the wheel puller. It looks like a corkscrew.

This? Yeah.

(BANGING)

Hold on to me, all right?

Look! It's Koopa's tower!

Those guys will do anything for publicity.

Mario?

Ugh! Dah!

It's Brooklyn! My world!

Give me that devo g*n.

What is this?

(SQUEAKS)

Monkey!

Scapelli?

Boss! What did they do to you?

And now, I'm gonna make a monkey out of you, plumber.

Trust the fungus.

What? No!

Bob-omb!

What are you doing? It's OK.

He's a friend.

Mario!

sh**t him! sh**t him!

(PLAYS 'Somewhere My Love')

(WHISTLE)

Stupid!

Agh!

Plumber!

Get those plumbers!

Duck!

(BEEPING)

(SCREAM)

(ALL SCREAMING)

See ya later, alligator.

(CHEERING)

Need a lift? What?

Come on. Get on my feet. All right.

Oh, Luigi! Mario!

I'm back!

Love those plumbers.

It's solid.

All right! Come on. Let's go.

I can't.

You mean you wanna stay?

Until we can get things settled here and... I can get to know my father.

Come on, Daisy. You know how I feel about you, right?

I wanna be with you.

I do too but...

I can't.

She's trying to tell you she can't leave here till she knows where she belongs.

If you loved her, you'd understand that.

And if I had any sense, I'd mind my own business.

OK, come on.

Come on.

It's open. Come on, Luigi.

Come on.

Are these the sounds of a music that comes to us across the vastness of space?

Judge for yourself.

Hey, love the dress. I've never seen it before.

That's what you said last time you saw it, Mr Wonderful!

Luigi, are you gonna stop moping around? Come on.

Luigi, come and eat.

...story of the Mario Brothers.

Mario! We're on The Miraculous World. Hurry up!

...heroes courageously managed to return the missing Brooklyn girls and save a parallel world from a ruthless dictator.

I'd call them the Super Mario Brothers.

Yes! Glug-glug-glug-glug!

(KNOCKING) It's open.

Luigi! Mario!

Daisy!

You gotta come with me. I need your help.

What's wrong?

You're never gonna believe this.

I believe it. You do?

I believe.
